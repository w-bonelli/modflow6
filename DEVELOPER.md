## Prerequisites

Before you can build and test MODFLOW 6, you must install and configure the
following on your development machine:

- git
- Python3.8+
- a modern Fortran compiler

Some additional, optional tools are also discussed below.

### Git

[Git](https://git-scm.com) and/or the **GitHub app** (for [Mac](https://mac.github.com) or [Windows](https://windows.github.com)).
[GitHub's Guide to Installing Git](https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git) is a good source of information.

### Fortran compiler

The GNU Fortran compiler `gfortran` or the Intel Fortran Classic compiler `ifort` can be used to compile MODFLOW 6.

**Note:** the next-generation Intel Fortran compiler `ifx` is not yet compatible with MODFLOW 6.

#### GNU Fortran

GNU Fortran can be installed on all three major platforms.

##### Linux

- fedora-based: `dnf install gcc-gfortran`
- debian-based: `apt install gfortran`

##### macOS

- [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/): `brew install gcc@13`
- [MacPorts](https://www.macports.org/): `sudo port install gcc13`

**Note:** Xcode 15 includes a new linker implementation which breaks GNU Fortran compatibility. A workaround is to set `LDFLAGS` to use the classic linker, for instance:

```shell
export LDFLAGS="$LDFLAGS -Wl,-ld_classic"
```

See [this ticket](https://github.com/mesonbuild/meson/issues/12282) on the Meson repository for more information.

##### Windows

- Download the Minimalist GNU for Windows (MinGW) installer from Source Forge:
  https://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw-w64/files/Toolchains%20targetting%20Win32/Personal%20Builds/mingw-builds/installer/mingw-w64-install.exe
- Run the installer. Make sure to change `Architecture` to `x86_64`. Leave the
  other settings on default.
- Find the `mingw64/bin` directory in the installation and add it
  to your PATH. Find `Edit the system environment variables` in your Windows
  Start Screen. Click the `Environmental Variables` button and double-click the
  `Path` variable in the User Variables (the top table). Click the `New` button
  and enter the location of the `mingw64/bin` directory.

#### Intel Fortran

Intel Fortran can also be used to compile MODFLOW 6 and associated utilities. The `ifort` and `ifx` compilers are available in the [Intel oneAPI HPC Toolkit](https://software.intel.com/content/www/us/en/develop/tools/oneapi/hpc-toolkit/download.html).

A number of environment variables must be set before using Intel Fortran. General information can be found [here](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/develop/documentation/oneapi-programming-guide/top/oneapi-development-environment-setup.html), with specific instructions to configure a shell session for `ifort` [here](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/develop/documentation/fortran-compiler-oneapi-dev-guide-and-reference/top/compiler-setup/use-the-command-line/specifying-the-location-of-compiler-components.html).

While the current development version of MODFLOW 6 is broadly compatible with `ifort`, `ifx` compatibility is still limited on Ubuntu and Windows, and `ifx` is not supported on macOS.

##### Windows

On Windows, [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com) and a number of libraries must be installed for `ifort` to work. The required libraries can be installed by ticking the "Desktop Development with C++" checkbox in the Visual Studio Installer's Workloads tab. 

**Note:** Invoking the `setvars.bat` scripts from a Powershell session will *not* put `ifort` on the path, since [batch script environments are local to their process](https://stackoverflow.com/a/49028002/6514033). To relaunch PowerShell with oneAPI variables configured:

```
cmd.exe "/K" '"C:\Program Files (x86)\Intel\oneAPI\setvars-vcvarsall.bat" && "C:\Program Files (x86)\Intel\oneAPI\compiler\latest\env\vars.bat" && powershell'
```

#### Compiler compatibility

The following tables are automatically generated by [a CI workflow](.github/workflows/compilers.yml).

##### Compile

<!-- test compat ends -->

### Python

Python 3.8+ is required to run MODFLOW 6 tests. A Conda distribution (e.g. [miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html) or [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual) is recommended. Python dependencies are specified in `environment.yml`. To create an environment, run from the project root:

```
conda env create -f environment.yml
```

To update an existing environment:

```shell
conda env update -f environment.yml
```

#### Dependencies

This project depends critically on a few Python packages for building, linting and testing tasks:

- `meson`
- `fprettify`
- `pymake`
- `flopy`

These are each described briefly below. The Conda `environment.yml` contains a number of other dependencies also required for various development tasks, but they are not described in detail here.

##### `meson`

[Meson](https://mesonbuild.com/index.html) is recommended for building MODFLOW 6 and is included in `environment.yml`. It can also be [installed independently](https://mesonbuild.com/Getting-meson.html) &mdash; note that if you do so you will need to manually add the executable to the [PATH](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PATH_(variable)).

##### `fprettify`

[`fprettify`](https://github.com/pseewald/fprettify) can be used to format Fortran source code and in combination with the [MODFLOW 6 fprettify configuration](.fprettify.yaml) establishes a contribution standard for properly formatted MODFLOW 6 Fortran source. This tool can be installed with `pip` or `conda` and used from the command line or integrated with a [VSCode](.vscode/README.md) or Visual Studio development environment. The `fprettify` package is included in the Conda environment in `environment.yml`. See [contribution guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md) for additional information.

##### `mfpymake`

The `mfpymake` package can build MODFLOW 6 and related programs and artifacts (e.g. makefiles), and is used in particular by the `distribution/build_makefiles.py` script. `mfpymake` is included in the Conda environment in `environment.yml`. To install separately, follow the instructions as explained on the README of the [repository](https://github.com/modflowpy/pymake). The README also demonstrates basic usage.

##### `flopy`

[`flopy`](https://github.com/modflowpy/flopy) is used throughout MODFLOW 6 tests to create, run and post-process models.

Like MODFLOW 6, `flopy` is modular &mdash; for each MODFLOW 6 package there is generally a corresponding `flopy` package. Packages are generated dynamically from DFN files stored in this repository under `doc/mf6io/mf6ivar/dfn`.

##### `modflow-devtools`

The tests use a set of shared fixtures and utilities provided by the [`modflow-devtools`](https://github/com/MODFLOW-USGS/modflow-devtools) package. This package is included in the Conda environment in `environment.yml`.

### Optional tools

Some other tools are useful but not required to develop MODFLOW 6.

#### GNU Make

This repository provides makefiles, generated by `mfpymake`, which can be used to build MODFLOW 6 with [GNU Make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/). For further instructions we refer to the [GNU Make Manual](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/).

#### Visual Studio

Visual Studio installers can be downloaded from the [official website](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/). MODFLOW 6 solution files can be found in the `msvs` folder.

#### Doxygen & LaTeX

[Doxygen](https://www.doxygen.nl/index.html) is used to generate the [MODFLOW 6 source code documentation](https://modflow-usgs.github.io/modflow6/). [Graphviz](https://graphviz.org/) is used by doxygen to produce source code diagrams. [LaTeX](https://www.latex-project.org/) is used to generate the MODFLOW 6 release notes and Input/Output documents (docs/mf6io/mf6io.nightlybuild).

These programs can be installed from various sources, including by conda, macports, or from individual sources such as https://www.tug.org/. Details about USGS LaTeX libraries can be seen in addition to linux installs in the CI workflow for the docs (`.github/workflows/ci-docs.yml`).

## Installation

Fork and clone the MODFLOW 6 repository:

1. Login to your GitHub account or create one by following the instructions given [here](https://github.com/signup/free).
2. [Fork](http://help.github.com/forking) the [main MODFLOW 6](https://github.com/MODFLOW-USGS/modflow6).
3. Clone your fork of the MODFLOW 6 repository and create an `upstream` remote pointing back to your fork.

```shell
# Clone your GitHub repository:
git clone git@github.com:<github username>/modflow6.git

# Go to the MODFLOW 6 directory:
cd modflow6

# Add the main MODFLOW 6 repository as an upstream remote to your repository:
git remote add upstream https://github.com/MODFLOW-USGS/modflow6.git
```

## Building

Meson is the recommended build tool for MODFLOW 6. [Meson](https://mesonbuild.com/Getting-meson.html) must be installed and on your [PATH](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PATH_(variable)). Creating and activating the Conda environment `environment.yml` should be sufficient for this.

Meson build configuration files are provided for MODFLOW 6, for the ZONEBUDGET and MODFLOW 2005 to 6 converter utility programs, and for Fortran unit tests (see [Testing](#testing) section below).

- `meson.build`
- `utils/zonebudget/meson.build`
- `utils/mf5to6/meson.build`
- `autotest/meson.build`

To build MODFLOW 6, first configure the build directory. By default Meson uses compiler flags for a release build. To create a debug build, add `-Doptimization=0` to the following `setup` command.

```shell
# bash (linux and macOS)
meson setup builddir --prefix=$(pwd) --libdir=bin

# cmd (windows)
meson setup builddir --prefix=%CD% --libdir=bin
```

Compile MODFLOW 6 by executing:

```shell
meson compile -C builddir
```

In order to run the tests the binaries have to be installed:

```shell
meson install -C builddir
```

The binaries can then be found in the `bin` folder. `meson install` also triggers a compilation if necessary, so executing `meson install` is enough to get up-to-date binaries in the `bin` folder.

**Note:** If using Visual Studio Code, you can use tasks as described [here](.vscode/README.md) to automate the above.

## Testing

MODFLOW 6 unit tests are written in Fortran with [`test-drive`](https://github.com/fortran-lang/test-drive).

MODFLOW 6 integration tests are written in Python with [`pytest`](https://docs.pytest.org/en/7.1.x/). Integration testing dependencies are included in the Conda environment `environment.yml`.

**Note:** the entire test suite should pass before a pull request is submitted. Tests run in GitHub Actions CI and a PR can only be merged with passing tests. See [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](CONTRIBUTING.md) for more information.

### Configuring a test environment

Before running tests, there are a few steps to complete. Most importantly, the local development version of MODFLOW 6 must be built, e.g. with Meson as described above.

The `autotest/build_exes.py` script is provided as a shortcut to rebuild local binaries. It can be invoked as a standard Python script or with Pytest. By default, binaries are placed in the `bin` directory relative to the project root, as in the Meson commands described above. To change the location of the binaries, use the `--path` option.

#### Configuring unit tests

Unit tests are [driven with Meson](https://mesonbuild.com/Unit-tests.html). A small number of Meson-native tests are defined in the top-level `meson.build` file to check that MODFLOW 6 has installed successfully. These require no additional configuration.

Additional Fortran unit tests are defined with [`test-drive`](https://github.com/fortran-lang/test-drive) in the `autotest/` folder, with test files named `Test*.f90`. If Meson fails to find the `test-drive` library via `pkg-config`, these will be skipped.

To install `test-drive`:

1. Clone the `test-drive` repository
2. Setup/build with Meson, e.g. in a Unix shell from the `test-drive` project root:

```shell
meson setup builddir --prefix=$PWD --libdir=lib
meson install -C builddir
```

3. Add `<test-drive project root>/lib/pkgconfig` to the `PKG_CONFIG_PATH` environment variable.
4. To confirm that `test-drive` is detected by `pkg-config`, run `pkg-config --libs test-drive`.

Meson should now detect the `test-drive` library when building MODFLOW 6.

**Note:** the `test-drive` source code is not yet compatible with recent versions of Intel Fortran, building with `gfortran` is recommended.

See the [Running unit tests](#running-unit-tests) section for instructions on running unit tests.

#### Configuring integration tests

A few more tasks must be completed before integration testing:

- install MODFLOW-related executables
- ensure FloPy packages are up to date
- install MODFLOW 6 example/test models

As mentioned above, binaries live in the `bin` subdirectory of the project root. This directory is organized as follows:

- local development binaries in the top-level `bin`
- binaries rebuilt in development mode from the latest MODFLOW 6 release in `bin/rebuilt/`
- related programs installed from the [executables distribution](https://github.com/MODFLOW-USGS/executables/releases) in `bin/downloaded/`

##### Rebuilding release binaries

Tests require the latest official MODFLOW 6 release to be compiled in develop mode with the same Fortran compiler as the development version. A number of binaries distributed from the [executables repo](https://github.com/MODFLOW-USGS/executables) must also be installed. The script `autotest/get_exes.py` does both of these things. It can be run from the project root with:

```shell
python autotest/get_exes.py
```

Alternatively, with `pytest` from the `autotest` directory:

```shell
pytest get_exes.py
```

As above, binaries are placed in the `bin` subdirectory of the project root, with nested `bin/downloaded` and `bin/rebuilt` subdirectories containing the rebuilt latest release and downloaded binaries, respectively.

##### Updating FloPy packages

FloPy packages should be regenerated from DFN files before running tests for the first time or after definition files change. This can be done with the `autotest/update_flopy.py` script, which wipes and regenerates package classes for the FloPy installed in the Python environment.

**Note:** if you've installed an editable local version of FloPy from source, running this script can overwrite files in your repository.

There is a single optional argument, the path to the folder containing definition files. By default DFN files are assumed to live in `doc/mf6io/mf6ivar/dfn`, making the following functionally identical:

```shell
python autotest/update_flopy.py
python autotest/update_flopy.py doc/mf6io/mf6ivar/dfn
```

##### Installing external models

Some autotests load models from external repositories:

- [`MODFLOW-USGS/modflow6-testmodels`](https://github.com/MODFLOW-USGS/modflow6-testmodels)
- [`MODFLOW-USGS/modflow6-largetestmodels`](https://github.com/MODFLOW-USGS/modflow6-largetestmodels)
- [`MODFLOW-USGS/modflow6-examples`](https://github.com/MODFLOW-USGS/modflow6-examples)

See the [MODFLOW devtools documentation](https://modflow-devtools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/md/install.html#installing-external-model-repositories) for instructions to install external model repositories.

### Running tests

MODFLOW 6 has two kinds of tests: Fortran unit tests, driven with Meson, and Python integration tests, driven with Pytest.

#### Running unit tests

Unit tests must be run from the project root. To run unit tests in verbose mode:

```shell
meson test -C builddir --no-rebuild --verbose
```

Without the `--no-rebuild` options, Meson will rebuild the project before running tests.

Unit tests can be selected by module name (as listed in `autotest/tester.f90`). For instance, to test the `ArrayHandlersModule`:

```shell
meson test -C builddir --no-rebuild --verbose ArrayHandlers
```

To run a test module in the `gdb` debugger, just add the `--gdb` flag to the test command.

#### Running integration tests

Integration tests must be run from the `autotest/` folder. To run tests in a particular file, showing verbose output, use:

```shell
pytest -v <file>
```

Tests can be run in parallel with the `-n` option, which accepts an integer argument for the number of parallel processes. If the value `auto` is provided, `pytest-xdist` will use one worker per available processor.

```shell
pytest -v -n auto
```

##### Selecting tests with markers

Markers can be used to select subsets of tests. Markers provided in `pytest.ini` include:

- `slow`: tests that take longer than a few seconds to complete
- `repo`: tests that require external model repositories
- `large`: tests using large models (from the `modflow6-examples` and `modflow6-largetestmodels` repos)
- `regression`: tests comparing results from multiple versions

Markers can be used with the `-m <marker>` option, and can be applied in boolean combinations with `and`, `or` and `not`. For instance, to run fast tests in parallel, excluding regression tests:

```shell
pytest -v -n auto -m "not slow and not regression"
```

The `--smoke` (short `-S`) flag, provided by `modflow-devtools` is an alias for the above:

```shell
pytest -v -n auto -S
```

[Smoke testing](https://modflow-devtools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/md/markers.html#smoke-testing) is a form of integration testing which aims to test a decent fraction of the codebase quickly enough to run often during development.

Tests using models from external repositories can be selected with the `repo` marker:

```shell
pytest -v -n auto -m "repo"
```

The `large` marker is a subset of the `repo` marker. To test models excluded from commit-triggered CI and only run on GitHub Actions nightly:

```shell
pytest -v -n auto -m "large"
```

Tests load external models from fixtures provided by `modflow-devtools`. External model tests can be selected by model or simulation name, or by packages used. See the [`modflow-devtools` documentation](https://modflow-devtools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/md/fixtures.html#filtering) for usage examples. Note that filtering options only apply to tests using external models, and will not filter tests defining models in code &mdash; for that, the `pytest` built-in `-k` option may be used.

### Writing tests

#### Writing unit tests

To add a new unit test:

- Add a file containing a test module, e.g. `TestArithmetic.f90`, to the `autotest/` folder.

```fortran
module TestArithmetic
  use testdrive, only : error_type, unittest_type, new_unittest, check, test_failed
  implicit none
  private
  public :: collect_arithmetic
contains
  
  subroutine collect_arithmetic(testsuite)
    type(unittest_type), allocatable, intent(out) :: testsuite(:)
    testsuite = [new_unittest("add", test_add)]
  end subroutine collect_arithmetic

  subroutine test_add(error)
    type(error_type), allocatable, intent(out) :: error
    call check(error, 1 + 1 == 2, "Math works")
    if (allocated(error)) then
      call test_failed(error, "Math is broken")
      return
    end if
  end subroutine test_add
end module TestArithmetic
```

- Add the module name to the list of `tests` in `autotest/meson.build`, omitting the leading "Test".

```fortran
tests = [
  'Arithmetic',
]
```

- Add a `use` statement for the test module in `autotest/tester.f90`, and add it to the array of `testsuites`.

```fortran
use TestArithmetic, only: collect_arithmetic
...
testsuites = [ &
  new_testsuite("Arithmetic", collect_arithmetic), &
  new_testsuite("something_else", collect_something_else) &
]
```

- Rebuild with Meson from the project root, e.g. `meson install -C builddir`. The test should now be picked up when `meson test...` is next invoked.

#### Writing integration tests

Integration tests should ideally follow a few conventions for easier maintenance:

- Use temporary directory fixtures. Tests which write to disk should use `pytest`'s built-in `tmp_path` fixtures or one of the [keepable temporary directory fixtures from `modflow-devtools`](https://modflow-devtools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/md/fixtures.html#keepable-temporary-directories). This prevents tests from polluting one another's state.

- Use markers for convenient (de-)selection:
  - `@pytest.mark.slow` if the test doesn't complete in a few seconds (this preserves the ability to quickly [`--smoke` test](https://modflow-devtools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/md/markers.html#smoke-testing)
  - `@pytest.mark.repo` if the test relies on external model repositories
  - `@pytest.mark.regression` if the test compares results from different versions

**Note:** If all three external model repositories are not installed as described above, some tests will be skipped. The full test suite includes >750 cases. All must pass before changes can be merged into this repository.

## Generating makefiles

Run `build_makefiles.py` in the `distribution/` directory after adding, removing, or renaming source files. This script uses [Pymake](https://github.com/modflowpy/pymake) to regenerate makefiles. For instance:

```shell
python build_makefiles.py
```

### Updating extra and excluded files

If the utilities located in the `utils` directory (e.g., `mf5to6` and `zbud6`) are affected by changes to the modflow6 `src/` directory (such as new or refactored source files), then the new module source file should also be added to the utility's `utils/<util>/pymake/extrafiles.txt` file. This file informs Pymake of source files living outside the main source directory, so they can be included in generated makefiles.

Module dependencies for features still under development should be added to `excludefiles.txt`. Source files listed in this file will be excluded from makefiles generated by Pymake. Makefiles should only include the source files needed to the build officially released/supported features.

### Testing makefiles

Makefile generation and usage can be tested from the `distribution` directory by running the `build_makefiles.py` script with Pytest:

```shell
pytest -v build_makefiles.py
```

**Note**: `make` is required to test compiling MODFLOW 6 with makefiles. If `make` is not discovered on the system path, compile tests will be skipped.

Makefiles may also be tested manually by changing to the appropriate `make` subdirectory (of the project root for MODFLOW 6, or inside the corresponding `utils` subdirectory for the zonebudget or converter utilities) and invoking `make` (`make clean` may first be necessary to remove previously created object files).

### Installing `make` on Windows

On Windows, it is recommended to generate and test makefiles from a Unix-like shell rather than PowerShell or Command Prompt. Make can be installed via [Conda](https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/make) or [Chocolatey](https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/make). Alternatively, it is included with [mingw](https://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw/), which is also available from [Chocolatey](https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/mingw).

#### Using Conda from Git Bash

To use Conda from Git Bash on Windows, first run the `conda.sh` script located in your Conda installation's `/etc/profile.d` subdirectory. For instance, with Anaconda3:

```shell
. /c/Anaconda3/etc/profile.d/conda.sh
```

Or Miniconda3:

```shell
. /c/ProgramData/miniconda3/etc/profile.d/conda.sh
```

After this, `conda` commands should be available.

This command may be added to a `.bashrc` or `.bash_profile` file in your home directory to permanently configure Git Bash for Conda.

## Branching model

This section documents MODFLOW 6 branching strategy and other VCS-related procedures.

### Overview

This project follows the [git flow](https://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/): development occurs on the `develop` branch, while `master` is reserved for the state of the latest release. Development PRs are typically squashed to `develop` to avoid merge commits. At release time, release branches are merged to `master`, and then `master` is merged back into `develop`.

### Managing long-lived branches

When a feature branch takes a long time to develop, it is easy to become out of sync with the develop branch.  Depending on the situation, it may be advisable to periodically squash the commits on the feature branch and rebase the change set with develop.  The following approach for updating a long-lived feature branch has proven robust.

In the example below, the feature branch is assumed to be called `feat-xyz`.

#### Backup

Begin by creating a backup copy of the feature branch in case anything goes terribly wrong.

```
git checkout feat-xyz
git checkout -b feat-xyz-backup
git checkout feat-xyz
```

#### Squash

Next, consider squashing commits on the feature branch.  If there are many commits, it is beneficial to squash them before trying to rebase with develop.  There is a nice article on [squashing commits into one using git](https://www.internalpointers.com/post/squash-commits-into-one-git), which has been very useful for consolidating commits on a long-lived modflow6 feature branch.

A quick and dirty way to squash without interactive rebase (as an alternative to the approach described in the article mentioned in the preceding paragraph) is a soft reset followed by an ammended commit. First making a backup of the feature branch is strongly recommended before using this approach, as accidentally typing `--hard` instead of `--soft` will wipe out all your work.

```
git reset --soft <first new commit on the feature branch>
git commit --amend -m "consolidated commit message"
```

Once the commits on the feature branch have been consolidated, a force push to origin is recommended.  This is not strictly required, but it can serve as an intermediate backup/checkpoint so the squashed branch state can be retrieved if rebasing fails.  The following command will push `feat-xyz` to origin.

```
git push origin feat-xyz --force
```

The `--force` flag's short form is `-f`.

#### Rebase

Now that the commits on `feat-xyz` have been consolidated, it is time to rebase with develop.  If there are multiple commits in `feat-xyz` that make changes, undo them, rename files, and/or move things around in subsequent commits, then there may be multiple sets of merge conflicts that will need to be resolved as the rebase works its way through the commit change sets.  This is why it is beneficial to squash the feature commits before rebasing with develop.

To rebase with develop, make sure the feature branch is checked out and then type:

```
git rebase develop
```

If anything goes wrong during a rebase, there is the `rebase --abort` command to unwind it.

If there are merge conflicts, they will need to be resolved before going forward.  Once any conflicts are resolved, it may be worthwhile to rebuild the MODFLOW 6 program and run the smoke tests to ensure nothing is broken.  

At this point, you will want to force push the updated feature branch to origin using the same force push command as before.

```
git push origin feat-xyz --force
```

#### Cleanup

Lastly, if you are satisfied with the results and confident the procedure went well, then you can delete the backup that you created at the start.

```
git branch -d feat-xyz-backup
```

This process can be repeated periodically to stay in sync with the develop branch and keep a clean commit history.

## Deprecation policy

To deprecate a MODFLOW 6 input/output option in a DFN file:

- Add a new `deprecated x.y.z` attribute to the appropriate variable in the package DFN file, where `x.y.z` is the version the deprecation is introduced. Mention the deprecation prominently in the release notes.
- If support for the deprecated option is removed (typically after at least 2 minor or major releases or 1 year), add a new `removed x.y.z` attribute to the variable in the DFN file, where `x.y.z` is the version in which support for the option was removed. The line containing `deprecated x.y.z` should not be deleted. Mention the removal prominently in the release notes.
- Deprecated/removed attributes are not removed from DFN files but remain in perpetuity. The `doc/mf6io/mf6ivar/deprecations.py` script generates a markdown deprecation table which is converted to LaTeX by `doc/ReleaseNotes/mk_deprecations.py` for inclusion in the MODFLOW 6 release notes. Deprecations and removals should still be mentioned separately in the release notes, however.

### Finding deprecations

To search for deprecations and removals in DFN files on a system with `git` and standard Unix commands available:

```shell
git grep 'deprecated' -- '*.dfn' | awk '/^*.dfn:deprecated/'
```
