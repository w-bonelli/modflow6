Flow Model Interface (FMI) Package information is read from the file that is specified by ``FMI6'' as the file type.  The FMI Package is required, and only one FMI Package can be specified for a PRT model.

For most simulations, the PRT Model needs groundwater flows for every cell in the model grid, for all boundary conditions, and for other terms, such as the flow of water in or out of storage.  The FMI Package is the interface between the PRT Model and simulated groundwater flows provided by a corresponding GWF Model that is running concurrently within the simulation or from binary budget files that were created from a previous GWF model run.  The following are several different FMI simulation cases:

\begin{itemize}

\item Flows are provided by a corresponding GWF Model running in the same simulation---in this case, all groundwater flows are calculated by the corresponding GWF Model and provided through FMI to the transport model.  This is a common use case in which the user wants to run the flow and particle-tracking models as part of a single simulation.  The GWF and PRT models must be part of a GWF-PRT Exchange that is listed in mfsim.nam.  If a GWF-PRT Exchange is specified by the user, then the user does not need to specify an FMI Package input file for the simulation, unless an FMI option is needed.  If a GWF-PRT Exchange is specified and the FMI Package is specified, then the PACKAGEDATA block below is not read or used.

\item Flows are provided from a previous GWF model simulation---in this case FMI should be provided in the PRT name file and the head and budget files should be listed in the FMI PACKAGEDATA block.  In this case, FMI reads the simulated head and flows from these files and makes them available to the particle-trcking model.  There are some additional considerations when the heads and flows are provided from binary files.

\begin{itemize}
\item The binary budget file must contain the simulated flows for all of the packages that were included in the GWF model run.  Saving of flows can be activated for all packages by specifying ``SAVE\_FLOWS'' as an option in the GWF name file.  The GWF Output Control Package must also have ``SAVE BUGET ALL'' specified.  The easiest way to ensure that all flows and heads are saved is to use the following simple form of a GWF Output Control file:

\begin{verbatim}
BEGIN OPTIONS
  HEAD FILEOUT mymodel.hds
  BUDGET FILEOUT mymodel.bud
END OPTIONS

BEGIN PERIOD 1
  SAVE HEAD ALL
  SAVE BUDGET ALL
END PERIOD
\end{verbatim}

\item The binary budget file must have the same number of budget terms listed for each time step.  This will always be the case when the binary budget file is created by \mf.
\item The binary heads file must have heads saved for all layers in the model.  This will always be the case when the binary head file is created by \mf.  This was not always the case as previous MODFLOW versions allowed different save options for each layer.
\item If the binary budget and head files have more than one time step for a single stress period, then the budget and head information must be contained within the binary file for every time step in the simulation stress period.
\item The binary budget and head files must correspond in terms of information stored for each time step and stress period.
\item If the binary budget and head files have information provided for only the first time step of a given stress period, this information will be used for all time steps in that stress period in the PRT simulation. If the final (or only) stress period in the binary budget and head files contains data for only one time step, this information will be used for any subsequent time steps and stress periods in the PRT simulation. This makes it possible to provide flows, for example, from a steady-state GWF stress period and have those flows used for all PRT time steps in that stress period, for all remaining time steps in the PRT simulation, or for all time steps throughout the entire GWT simulation. With this option, it is possible to have smaller time steps in the PRT simulation than the time steps used in the GWF simulation. Note that this cannot be done when the GWF and PRT models are run in the same simulation, because in that case, both models are solved over the same sequence of time steps and stress periods, as listed in the TDIS Package. The option to read flows from a previous GWF simulation via Flow Model Interface may offer an efficient alternative to running both models in the same simulation, but comes at the cost of having potentially very large budget files.
\end{itemize}

\end{itemize}

\noindent Determination of which FMI use case to invoke requires careful consideration of the different advantages and disadvantages of each case.  For example, running PRT and GWF in the same simulation can often be faster because GWF flows are passed through memory to the PRT model instead of being written to files.  The disadvantage of this approach is that the same time step lengths must be used for both GWF and PRT.  Ultimately, it should be relatively straightforward to test different ways in which GWF and PRT interact and select the use case most appropriate for the particular problem.
