| EXG | GWFGWF | OPTIONS | MVR6_FILENAME | STRING | is the file name of the water mover input file to apply to this exchange.  Information for the water mover are provided in the file provided with these keywords.  The format for specifying the water mover information is the same as described for the Water Mover (MVR) Package of the GWF Model, with two exceptions.  First, in the PACKAGES block, the model name must be included as a separate string before each package.  Second, the appropriate model name must be included before package name 1 and package name 2 in the BEGIN PERIOD block.

| SLN | IMS | OPTIONS | PRINT_OPTION | STRING | is a flag that controls printing of convergence information from the solver.  NONE means print nothing. SUMMARY means print only the total number of iterations and nonlinear residual reduction summaries. ALL means print linear matrix solver convergence information to the solution listing file and model specific linear matrix solver convergence information to each model listing file in addition to SUMMARY information. NONE is default if PRINT\_OPTION is not specified. |
| SLN | IMS | OPTIONS | COMPLEXITY | STRING | is an optional keyword that defines default non-linear and linear solver parameters.  SIMPLE - indicates that default solver input values will be defined that work well for nearly linear models. This would be used for models that do not include nonlinear stress packages and models that are either confined or consist of a single unconfined layer that is thick enough to contain the water table within a single layer. MODERATE - indicates that default solver input values will be defined that work well for moderately nonlinear models. This would be used for models that include nonlinear stress packages and models that consist of one or more unconfined layers. The MODERATE option should be used when the SIMPLE option does not result in successful convergence.  COMPLEX - indicates that default solver input values will be defined that work well for highly nonlinear models. This would be used for models that include nonlinear stress packages and models that consist of one or more unconfined layers representing complex geology and surface-water/groundwater interaction. The COMPLEX option should be used when the MODERATE option does not result in successful convergence.  Non-linear and linear solver parameters assigned using a specified complexity can be modified in the NONLINEAR and LINEAR blocks. If the COMPLEXITY option is not specified, NONLINEAR and LINEAR variables will be assigned the simple complexity values. |
| SLN | IMS | OPTIONS | CSV_OUTPUT | KEYWORD | keyword to specify that the record corresponds to the comma separated values solver convergence output.  The CSV\_OUTPUT option has been deprecated and split into the CSV_OUTER_OUTPUT and CSV_INNER_OUTPUT options.  Starting with MODFLOW 6 version 6.1.1 if the CSV_OUTPUT option is specified, then it is treated as the CSV_OUTER_OUTPUT option. |
| SLN | IMS | OPTIONS | CSVFILE | STRING | name of the ascii comma separated values output file to write solver convergence information. If PRINT\_OPTION is NONE or SUMMARY, comma separated values output includes maximum head change convergence information at the end of each outer iteration for each time step. If PRINT\_OPTION is ALL, comma separated values output includes maximum head change and maximum residual convergence information for the solution and each model (if the solution includes more than one model) and linear acceleration information for each inner iteration. |
| SLN | IMS | OPTIONS | CSV_OUTER_OUTPUT | KEYWORD | keyword to specify that the record corresponds to the comma separated values outer iteration convergence output. |
| SLN | IMS | OPTIONS | FILEOUT | KEYWORD | keyword to specify that an output filename is expected next. |
| SLN | IMS | OPTIONS | OUTER_CSVFILE | STRING | name of the ascii comma separated values output file to write maximum dependent-variable (for example, head) change convergence information at the end of each outer iteration for each time step. |
| SLN | IMS | OPTIONS | CSV_INNER_OUTPUT | KEYWORD | keyword to specify that the record corresponds to the comma separated values solver convergence output. |
| SLN | IMS | OPTIONS | INNER_CSVFILE | STRING | name of the ascii comma separated values output file to write solver convergence information. Comma separated values output includes maximum dependent-variable (for example, head) change and maximum residual convergence information for the solution and each model (if the solution includes more than one model) and linear acceleration information for each inner iteration. |
| SLN | IMS | OPTIONS | NO_PTC | KEYWORD | is a flag that is used to disable pseudo-transient continuation (PTC). Option only applies to steady-state stress periods for models using the Newton-Raphson formulation. For many problems, PTC can significantly improve convergence behavior for steady-state simulations, and for this reason it is active by default.  In some cases, however, PTC can worsen the convergence behavior, especially when the initial conditions are similar to the solution.  When the initial conditions are similar to, or exactly the same as, the solution and convergence is slow, then the NO\_PTC FIRST option should be used to deactivate PTC for the first stress period.  The NO\_PTC ALL option should also be used in order to compare convergence behavior with other MODFLOW versions, as PTC is only available in MODFLOW 6. |
| SLN | IMS | OPTIONS | NO_PTC_OPTION | STRING | is an optional keyword that is used to define options for disabling pseudo-transient continuation (PTC). FIRST is an optional keyword to disable PTC for the first stress period, if steady-state and one or more model is using the Newton-Raphson formulation. ALL is an optional keyword to disable PTC for all steady-state stress periods for models using the Newton-Raphson formulation. If NO\_PTC\_OPTION is not specified, the NO\_PTC ALL option is used. |
| SLN | IMS | OPTIONS | ATS_OUTER_MAXIMUM_FRACTION | DOUBLE PRECISION | real value defining the fraction of the maximum allowable outer iterations used with the Adaptive Time Step (ATS) capability if it is active.  If this value is set to zero by the user, then this solution will have no effect on ATS behavior.  This value must be greater than or equal to zero and less than or equal to 0.5 or the program will terminate with an error.  If it is not specified by the user, then it is assigned a default value of one third.  When the number of outer iterations for this solution is less than the product of this value and the maximum allowable outer iterations, then ATS will increase the time step length by a factor of DTADJ in the ATS input file.  When the number of outer iterations for this solution is greater than the maximum allowable outer iterations minus the product of this value and the maximum allowable outer iterations, then the ATS (if active) will decrease the time step length by a factor of 1 / DTADJ. |
| SLN | IMS | NONLINEAR | OUTER_HCLOSE | DOUBLE PRECISION | real value defining the head change criterion for convergence of the outer (nonlinear) iterations, in units of length. When the maximum absolute value of the head change at all nodes during an iteration is less than or equal to OUTER\_HCLOSE, iteration stops. Commonly, OUTER\_HCLOSE equals 0.01.  The OUTER\_HCLOSE option has been deprecated in favor of the more general OUTER\_DVCLOSE (for dependent variable), however either one can be specified in order to maintain backward compatibility. |
| SLN | IMS | NONLINEAR | OUTER_DVCLOSE | DOUBLE PRECISION | real value defining the dependent-variable (for example, head) change criterion for convergence of the outer (nonlinear) iterations, in units of the dependent-variable (for example, length for head). When the maximum absolute value of the dependent-variable change at all nodes during an iteration is less than or equal to OUTER\_DVCLOSE, iteration stops. Commonly, OUTER\_DVCLOSE equals 0.01. The keyword, OUTER\_HCLOSE can be still be specified instead of OUTER\_DVCLOSE for backward compatibility with previous versions of MODFLOW 6 but eventually OUTER\_HCLOSE will be deprecated and specification of OUTER\_HCLOSE will cause MODFLOW 6 to terminate with an error. |
| SLN | IMS | NONLINEAR | OUTER_RCLOSEBND | DOUBLE PRECISION | real value defining the residual tolerance for convergence of model packages that solve a separate equation not solved by the IMS linear solver. This value represents the maximum allowable residual between successive outer iterations at any single model package element. An example of a model package that would use OUTER\_RCLOSEBND to evaluate convergence is the SFR package which solves a continuity equation for each reach.  The OUTER\_RCLOSEBND option is deprecated and has no effect on simulation results as of version 6.1.1.  The keyword, OUTER\_RCLOSEBND can be still be specified for backward compatibility with previous versions of MODFLOW 6 but eventually specificiation of OUTER\_RCLOSEBND will cause MODFLOW 6 to terminate with an error. |
| SLN | IMS | NONLINEAR | OUTER_MAXIMUM | INTEGER | integer value defining the maximum number of outer (nonlinear) iterations -- that is, calls to the solution routine. For a linear problem OUTER\_MAXIMUM should be 1. |
| SLN | IMS | NONLINEAR | UNDER_RELAXATION | STRING | is an optional keyword that defines the nonlinear under-relaxation schemes used. Under-relaxation is also known as dampening, and is used to reduce the size of the calculated dependent variable before proceeding to the next outer iteration.  Under-relaxation can be an effective tool for highly nonlinear models when there are large and often counteracting changes in the calculated dependent variable between successive outer iterations.  By default under-relaxation is not used.  NONE - under-relaxation is not used (default). SIMPLE - Simple under-relaxation scheme with a fixed relaxation factor (UNDER\_RELAXATION\_GAMMA) is used.  COOLEY - Cooley under-relaxation scheme is used.  DBD - delta-bar-delta under-relaxation is used.  Note that the under-relaxation schemes are often used in conjunction with problems that use the Newton-Raphson formulation, however, experience has indicated that they also work well for non-Newton problems, such as those with the wet/dry options of MODFLOW 6. |
| SLN | IMS | NONLINEAR | UNDER_RELAXATION_GAMMA | DOUBLE PRECISION | real value defining either the relaxation factor for the SIMPLE scheme or the history or memory term factor of the Cooley and delta-bar-delta algorithms. For the SIMPLE scheme, a value of one indicates that there is no under-relaxation and the full head change is applied.  This value can be gradually reduced from one as a way to improve convergence; for well behaved problems, using a value less than one can increase the number of outer iterations required for convergence and needlessly increase run times.  UNDER\_RELAXATION\_GAMMA must be greater than zero for the SIMPLE scheme or the program will terminate with an error.  For the Cooley and delta-bar-delta schemes, UNDER\_RELAXATION\_GAMMA is a memory term that can range between zero and one. When UNDER\_RELAXATION\_GAMMA is zero, only the most recent history (previous iteration value) is maintained. As UNDER\_RELAXATION\_GAMMA is increased, past history of iteration changes has greater influence on the memory term. The memory term is maintained as an exponential average of past changes. Retaining some past history can overcome granular behavior in the calculated function surface and therefore helps to overcome cyclic patterns of non-convergence. The value usually ranges from 0.1 to 0.3; a value of 0.2 works well for most problems. UNDER\_RELAXATION\_GAMMA only needs to be specified if UNDER\_RELAXATION is not NONE. |
| SLN | IMS | NONLINEAR | UNDER_RELAXATION_THETA | DOUBLE PRECISION | real value defining the reduction factor for the learning rate (under-relaxation term) of the delta-bar-delta algorithm. The value of UNDER\_RELAXATION\_THETA is between zero and one. If the change in the dependent-variable (for example, head) is of opposite sign to that of the previous iteration, the under-relaxation term is reduced by a factor of UNDER\_RELAXATION\_THETA. The value usually ranges from 0.3 to 0.9; a value of 0.7 works well for most problems. UNDER\_RELAXATION\_THETA only needs to be specified if UNDER\_RELAXATION is DBD. |
| SLN | IMS | NONLINEAR | UNDER_RELAXATION_KAPPA | DOUBLE PRECISION | real value defining the increment for the learning rate (under-relaxation term) of the delta-bar-delta algorithm. The value of UNDER\_RELAXATION\_kappa is between zero and one. If the change in the dependent-variable (for example, head) is of the same sign to that of the previous iteration, the under-relaxation term is increased by an increment of UNDER\_RELAXATION\_KAPPA. The value usually ranges from 0.03 to 0.3; a value of 0.1 works well for most problems. UNDER\_RELAXATION\_KAPPA only needs to be specified if UNDER\_RELAXATION is DBD. |
| SLN | IMS | NONLINEAR | UNDER_RELAXATION_MOMENTUM | DOUBLE PRECISION | real value defining the fraction of past history changes that is added as a momentum term to the step change for a nonlinear iteration. The value of UNDER\_RELAXATION\_MOMENTUM is between zero and one. A large momentum term should only be used when small learning rates are expected. Small amounts of the momentum term help convergence. The value usually ranges from 0.0001 to 0.1; a value of 0.001 works well for most problems. UNDER\_RELAXATION\_MOMENTUM only needs to be specified if UNDER\_RELAXATION is DBD. |
| SLN | IMS | NONLINEAR | BACKTRACKING_NUMBER | INTEGER | integer value defining the maximum number of backtracking iterations allowed for residual reduction computations. If BACKTRACKING\_NUMBER = 0 then the backtracking iterations are omitted. The value usually ranges from 2 to 20; a value of 10 works well for most problems. |
| SLN | IMS | NONLINEAR | BACKTRACKING_TOLERANCE | DOUBLE PRECISION | real value defining the tolerance for residual change that is allowed for residual reduction computations. BACKTRACKING\_TOLERANCE should not be less than one to avoid getting stuck in local minima. A large value serves to check for extreme residual increases, while a low value serves to control step size more severely. The value usually ranges from 1.0 to 10$^6$; a value of 10$^4$ works well for most problems but lower values like 1.1 may be required for harder problems. BACKTRACKING\_TOLERANCE only needs to be specified if BACKTRACKING\_NUMBER is greater than zero. |
| SLN | IMS | NONLINEAR | BACKTRACKING_REDUCTION_FACTOR | DOUBLE PRECISION | real value defining the reduction in step size used for residual reduction computations. The value of BACKTRACKING\_REDUCTION\_FACTOR is between zero and one. The value usually ranges from 0.1 to 0.3; a value of 0.2 works well for most problems. BACKTRACKING\_REDUCTION\_FACTOR only needs to be specified if BACKTRACKING\_NUMBER is greater than zero. |
| SLN | IMS | NONLINEAR | BACKTRACKING_RESIDUAL_LIMIT | DOUBLE PRECISION | real value defining the limit to which the residual is reduced with backtracking. If the residual is smaller than BACKTRACKING\_RESIDUAL\_LIMIT, then further backtracking is not performed. A value of 100 is suitable for large problems and residual reduction to smaller values may only slow down computations. BACKTRACKING\_RESIDUAL\_LIMIT only needs to be specified if BACKTRACKING\_NUMBER is greater than zero. |
| SLN | IMS | LINEAR | INNER_MAXIMUM | INTEGER | integer value defining the maximum number of inner (linear) iterations. The number typically depends on the characteristics of the matrix solution scheme being used. For nonlinear problems, INNER\_MAXIMUM usually ranges from 60 to 600; a value of 100 will be sufficient for most linear problems. |
| SLN | IMS | LINEAR | INNER_HCLOSE | DOUBLE PRECISION | real value defining the head change criterion for convergence of the inner (linear) iterations, in units of length. When the maximum absolute value of the head change at all nodes during an iteration is less than or equal to INNER\_HCLOSE, the matrix solver assumes convergence. Commonly, INNER\_HCLOSE is set equal to or an order of magnitude less than the OUTER\_HCLOSE value specified for the NONLINEAR block.  The INNER\_HCLOSE keyword has been deprecated in favor of the more general INNER\_DVCLOSE (for dependent variable), however either one can be specified in order to maintain backward compatibility. |
| SLN | IMS | LINEAR | INNER_DVCLOSE | DOUBLE PRECISION | real value defining the dependent-variable (for example, head) change criterion for convergence of the inner (linear) iterations, in units of the dependent-variable (for example, length for head). When the maximum absolute value of the dependent-variable change at all nodes during an iteration is less than or equal to INNER\_DVCLOSE, the matrix solver assumes convergence. Commonly, INNER\_DVCLOSE is set equal to or an order of magnitude less than the OUTER\_DVCLOSE value specified for the NONLINEAR block. The keyword, INNER\_HCLOSE can be still be specified instead of INNER\_DVCLOSE for backward compatibility with previous versions of MODFLOW 6 but eventually INNER\_HCLOSE will be deprecated and specification of INNER\_HCLOSE will cause MODFLOW 6 to terminate with an error. |
| SLN | IMS | LINEAR | INNER_RCLOSE | DOUBLE PRECISION | real value that defines the flow residual tolerance for convergence of the IMS linear solver and specific flow residual criteria used. This value represents the maximum allowable residual at any single node.  Value is in units of length cubed per time, and must be consistent with \mf length and time units. Usually a value of $1.0 \times 10^{-1}$ is sufficient for the flow-residual criteria when meters and seconds are the defined \mf length and time. |
| SLN | IMS | LINEAR | RCLOSE_OPTION | STRING | an optional keyword that defines the specific flow residual criterion used.  STRICT--an optional keyword that is used to specify that INNER\_RCLOSE represents a infinity-Norm (absolute convergence criteria) and that the dependent-variable (for example, head) and flow convergence criteria must be met on the first inner iteration (this criteria is equivalent to the criteria used by the MODFLOW-2005 PCG package~\citep{hill1990preconditioned}). L2NORM\_RCLOSE--an optional keyword that is used to specify that INNER\_RCLOSE represents a L-2 Norm closure criteria instead of a infinity-Norm (absolute convergence criteria). When L2NORM\_RCLOSE is specified, a reasonable initial INNER\_RCLOSE value is 0.1 times the number of active cells when meters and seconds are the defined \mf length and time.  RELATIVE\_RCLOSE--an optional keyword that is used to specify that INNER\_RCLOSE represents a relative L-2 Norm reduction closure criteria instead of a infinity-Norm (absolute convergence criteria). When RELATIVE\_RCLOSE is specified, a reasonable initial INNER\_RCLOSE value is $1.0 \times 10^{-4}$ and convergence is achieved for a given inner (linear) iteration when $\Delta h \le$ INNER\_DVCLOSE and the current L-2 Norm is $\le$ the product of the RELATIVE\_RCLOSE and the initial L-2 Norm for the current inner (linear) iteration. If RCLOSE\_OPTION is not specified, an absolute residual (infinity-norm) criterion is used. |
| SLN | IMS | LINEAR | LINEAR_ACCELERATION | STRING | a keyword that defines the linear acceleration method used by the default IMS linear solvers.  CG - preconditioned conjugate gradient method.  BICGSTAB - preconditioned bi-conjugate gradient stabilized method. |
| SLN | IMS | LINEAR | RELAXATION_FACTOR | DOUBLE PRECISION | optional real value that defines the relaxation factor used by the incomplete LU factorization preconditioners (MILU(0) and MILUT). RELAXATION\_FACTOR is unitless and should be greater than or equal to 0.0 and less than or equal to 1.0. RELAXATION\_FACTOR values of about 1.0 are commonly used, and experience suggests that convergence can be optimized in some cases with relax values of 0.97. A RELAXATION\_FACTOR value of 0.0 will result in either ILU(0) or ILUT preconditioning (depending on the value specified for PRECONDITIONER\_LEVELS and/or PRECONDITIONER\_DROP\_TOLERANCE). By default,  RELAXATION\_FACTOR is zero. |
| SLN | IMS | LINEAR | PRECONDITIONER_LEVELS | INTEGER | optional integer value defining the level of fill for ILU decomposition used in the ILUT and MILUT preconditioners. Higher levels of fill provide more robustness but also require more memory. For optimal performance, it is suggested that a large level of fill be applied (7 or 8) with use of a drop tolerance. Specification of a PRECONDITIONER\_LEVELS value greater than zero results in use of the ILUT preconditioner. By default, PRECONDITIONER\_LEVELS is zero and the zero-fill incomplete LU factorization preconditioners (ILU(0) and MILU(0)) are used. |
| SLN | IMS | LINEAR | PRECONDITIONER_DROP_TOLERANCE | DOUBLE PRECISION | optional real value that defines the drop tolerance used to drop preconditioner terms based on the magnitude of matrix entries in the ILUT and MILUT preconditioners. A value of $10^{-4}$ works well for most problems. By default, PRECONDITIONER\_DROP\_TOLERANCE is zero and the zero-fill incomplete LU factorization preconditioners (ILU(0) and MILU(0)) are used. |
| SLN | IMS | LINEAR | NUMBER_ORTHOGONALIZATIONS | INTEGER | optional integer value defining the interval used to explicitly recalculate the residual of the flow equation using the solver coefficient matrix, the latest dependent-variable (for example, head) estimates, and the right hand side. For problems that benefit from explicit recalculation of the residual, a number between 4 and 10 is appropriate. By default, NUMBER\_ORTHOGONALIZATIONS is zero. |
| SLN | IMS | LINEAR | SCALING_METHOD | STRING | an optional keyword that defines the matrix scaling approach used. By default, matrix scaling is not applied.  NONE - no matrix scaling applied.

| SLN | IMS | LINEAR | REORDERING_METHOD | STRING | an optional keyword that defines the matrix reordering approach used. By default, matrix reordering is not applied.  NONE - original ordering.  RCM - reverse Cuthill McKee ordering.  MD - minimum degree ordering. |
| SLN | PTS | OPTIONS | PRINT_OPTION | STRING | is a flag that controls printing of convergence information from the solver.  NONE means print nothing. SUMMARY means print only the total number of iterations and nonlinear residual reduction summaries. ALL means print linear matrix solver convergence information to the solution listing file and model specific linear matrix solver convergence information to each model listing file in addition to SUMMARY information. NONE is default if PRINT\_OPTION is not specified.  ??? NEEDS UPDATING ??? |
| SLN | PTS | OPTIONS | COMPLEXITY | STRING | is an optional keyword that defines default non-linear and linear solver parameters.  SIMPLE - indicates that default solver input values will be defined that work well for nearly linear models. This would be used for models that do not include nonlinear stress packages and models that are either confined or consist of a single unconfined layer that is thick enough to contain the water table within a single layer. MODERATE - indicates that default solver input values will be defined that work well for moderately nonlinear models. This would be used for models that include nonlinear stress packages and models that consist of one or more unconfined layers. The MODERATE option should be used when the SIMPLE option does not result in successful convergence.  COMPLEX - indicates that default solver input values will be defined that work well for highly nonlinear models. This would be used for models that include nonlinear stress packages and models that consist of one or more unconfined layers representing complex geology and surface-water/groundwater interaction. The COMPLEX option should be used when the MODERATE option does not result in successful convergence.  Non-linear and linear solver parameters assigned using a specified complexity can be modified in the NONLINEAR and LINEAR blocks. If the COMPLEXITY option is not specified, NONLINEAR and LINEAR variables will be assigned the simple complexity values. |
| SLN | PTS | OPTIONS | CSV_OUTPUT | KEYWORD | keyword to specify that the record corresponds to the comma separated values solver convergence output.  The CSV\_OUTPUT option has been deprecated and split into the CSV_OUTER_OUTPUT and CSV_INNER_OUTPUT options.  Starting with MODFLOW 6 version 6.1.1 if the CSV_OUTPUT option is specified, then it is treated as the CSV_OUTER_OUTPUT option. |
| SLN | PTS | OPTIONS | CSVFILE | STRING | name of the ascii comma separated values output file to write solver convergence information. If PRINT\_OPTION is NONE or SUMMARY, comma separated values output includes maximum head change convergence information at the end of each outer iteration for each time step. If PRINT\_OPTION is ALL, comma separated values output includes maximum head change and maximum residual convergence information for the solution and each model (if the solution includes more than one model) and linear acceleration information for each inner iteration. |
| SLN | PTS | OPTIONS | CSV_OUTER_OUTPUT | KEYWORD | keyword to specify that the record corresponds to the comma separated values outer iteration convergence output. |
| SLN | PTS | OPTIONS | FILEOUT | KEYWORD | keyword to specify that an output filename is expected next. |

| SLN | PTS | OPTIONS | CSV_INNER_OUTPUT | KEYWORD | keyword to specify that the record corresponds to the comma separated values solver convergence output. |
| SLN | PTS | OPTIONS | INNER_CSVFILE | STRING | name of the ascii comma separated values output file to write solver convergence information. Comma separated values output includes maximum dependent-variable (for example, head) change and maximum residual convergence information for the solution and each model (if the solution includes more than one model) and linear acceleration information for each inner iteration. |
| SLN | PTS | OPTIONS | NO_PTC | KEYWORD | is a flag that is used to disable pseudo-transient continuation (PTC). Option only applies to steady-state stress periods for models using the Newton-Raphson formulation. For many problems, PTC can significantly improve convergence behavior for steady-state simulations, and for this reason it is active by default.  In some cases, however, PTC can worsen the convergence behavior, especially when the initial conditions are similar to the solution.  When the initial conditions are similar to, or exactly the same as, the solution and convergence is slow, then the NO\_PTC FIRST option should be used to deactivate PTC for the first stress period.  The NO\_PTC ALL option should also be used in order to compare convergence behavior with other MODFLOW versions, as PTC is only available in MODFLOW 6. |
| SLN | PTS | OPTIONS | NO_PTC_OPTION | STRING | is an optional keyword that is used to define options for disabling pseudo-transient continuation (PTC). FIRST is an optional keyword to disable PTC for the first stress period, if steady-state and one or more model is using the Newton-Raphson formulation. ALL is an optional keyword to disable PTC for all steady-state stress periods for models using the Newton-Raphson formulation. If NO\_PTC\_OPTION is not specified, the NO\_PTC ALL option is used. |
| SLN | PTS | OPTIONS | ATS_OUTER_MAXIMUM_FRACTION | DOUBLE PRECISION | real value defining the fraction of the maximum allowable outer iterations used with the Adaptive Time Step (ATS) capability if it is active.  If this value is set to zero by the user, then this solution will have no effect on ATS behavior.  This value must be greater than or equal to zero and less than or equal to 0.5 or the program will terminate with an error.  If it is not specified by the user, then it is assigned a default value of one third.  When the number of outer iterations for this solution is less than the product of this value and the maximum allowable outer iterations, then ATS will increase the time step length by a factor of DTADJ in the ATS input file.  When the number of outer iterations for this solution is greater than the maximum allowable outer iterations minus the product of this value and the maximum allowable outer iterations, then the ATS (if active) will decrease the time step length by a factor of 1 / DTADJ. |
| SLN | PTS | NONLINEAR | OUTER_MAXIMUM | INTEGER | integer value defining the maximum number of outer (nonlinear) iterations -- that is, calls to the solution routine. For a linear problem OUTER\_MAXIMUM should be 1. |
| GWF | NAM | OPTIONS | LIST | STRING | is name of the listing file to create for this GWF model.  If not specified, then the name of the list file will be the basename of the GWF model name file and the '.lst' extension.  For example, if the GWF name file is called ``my.model.nam'' then the list file will be called ``my.model.lst''. |
| GWF | NAM | OPTIONS | PRINT_INPUT | KEYWORD | keyword to indicate that the list of all model stress package information will be written to the listing file immediately after it is read. |
| GWF | NAM | OPTIONS | PRINT_FLOWS | KEYWORD | keyword to indicate that the list of all model package flow rates will be printed to the listing file for every stress period time step in which ``BUDGET PRINT'' is specified in Output Control.  If there is no Output Control option and ``PRINT\_FLOWS'' is specified, then flow rates are printed for the last time step of each stress period. |
| GWF | NAM | OPTIONS | SAVE_FLOWS | KEYWORD | keyword to indicate that all model package flow terms will be written to the file specified with ``BUDGET FILEOUT'' in Output Control. |
| GWF | NAM | OPTIONS | NEWTON | KEYWORD | keyword that activates the Newton-Raphson formulation for groundwater flow between connected, convertible groundwater cells and stress packages that support calculation of Newton-Raphson terms for groundwater exchanges.

| GWF | NAM | OPTIONS | UNDER_RELAXATION | KEYWORD | keyword that indicates whether the groundwater head in a cell will be under-relaxed when water levels fall below the bottom of the model below any given cell. By default, Newton-Raphson UNDER\_RELAXATION is not applied. |
| GWF | NAM | PACKAGES | FTYPE | STRING | is the file type, which must be one of the following character values shown in table~\ref{table:ftype}. Ftype may be entered in any combination of uppercase and lowercase. |
| GWF | NAM | PACKAGES | FNAME | STRING | is the name of the file containing the package input.  The path to the file should be included if the file is not located in the folder where the program was run. |
| GWF | NAM | PACKAGES | PNAME | STRING | is the user-defined name for the package. PNAME is restricted to 16 characters.  No spaces are allowed in PNAME.  PNAME character values are read and stored by the program for stress packages only.  These names may be useful for labeling purposes when multiple stress packages of the same type are located within a single GWF Model.  If PNAME is specified for a stress package, then PNAME will be used in the flow budget table in the listing file; it will also be used for the text entry in the cell-by-cell budget file.  PNAME is case insensitive and is stored in all upper case letters. |

| GWF | DIS | OPTIONS | XORIGIN | DOUBLE PRECISION | x-position of the lower-left corner of the model grid.  A default value of zero is assigned if not specified.

| GWF | DIS | OPTIONS | YORIGIN | DOUBLE PRECISION | y-position of the lower-left corner of the model grid.  If not specified, then a default value equal to zero is used.  The value for YORIGIN does not affect the model simulation, but it is written to the binary grid file so that postprocessors can locate the grid in space. |
| GWF | DIS | OPTIONS | ANGROT | DOUBLE PRECISION | counter-clockwise rotation angle (in degrees) of the lower-left corner of the model grid.  If not specified, then a default value of 0.0 is assigned.

| GWF | DIS | GRIDDATA | IDOMAIN | INTEGER (NCOL, NROW, NLAY) | is an optional array that characterizes the existence status of a cell.  If the IDOMAIN array is not specified, then all model cells exist within the solution.  If the IDOMAIN value for a cell is 0, the cell does not exist in the simulation.  Input and output values will be read and written for the cell, but internal to the program, the cell is excluded from the solution.  If the IDOMAIN value for a cell is 1 or greater, the cell exists in the simulation.  If the IDOMAIN value for a cell is -1, the cell does not exist in the simulation.  Furthermore, the first existing cell above will be connected to the first existing cell below.  This type of cell is referred to as a ``vertical pass through'' cell. |

| GWF | DISU | DIMENSIONS | NJA | INTEGER | is the sum of the number of connections and NODES.  When calculating the total number of connections, the connection between cell n and cell m is considered to be different from the connection between cell m and cell n.  Thus, NJA is equal to the total number of connections, including n to m and m to n, and the total number of cells. |
| GWF | DISU | DIMENSIONS | NVERT | INTEGER | is the total number of (x, y) vertex pairs used to define the plan-view shape of each cell in the model grid.  If NVERT is not specified or is specified as zero, then the VERTICES and CELL2D blocks below are not read.  NVERT and the accompanying VERTICES and CELL2D blocks should be specified for most simulations.  If the XT3D or SAVE\_SPECIFIC\_DISCHARGE options are specified in the NPF Package, then this information is required. |
| GWF | DISU | GRIDDATA | TOP | DOUBLE PRECISION (NODES) | is the top elevation for each cell in the model grid. |

If the IDOMAIN array is not specified, then all model cells exist within the solution.  If the IDOMAIN value for a cell is 0, the cell does not exist in the simulation.  Input and output values will be read and written for the cell, but internal to the program, the cell is excluded from the solution.  If the IDOMAIN value for a cell is 1 or greater, the cell exists in the simulation.  IDOMAIN values of -1 cannot be specified for the DISU Package. |
| GWF | DISU | CONNECTIONDATA | IAC | INTEGER (NODES) | is the number of connections (plus 1) for each cell.  The sum of all the entries in IAC must be equal to NJA. |
| GWF | DISU | CONNECTIONDATA | JA | INTEGER (NJA) | is a list of cell number (n) followed by its connecting cell numbers (m) for each of the m cells connected to cell n. The number of values to provide for cell n is IAC(n).  This list is sequentially provided for the first to the last cell. The first value in the list must be cell n itself, and the remaining cells must be listed in an increasing order (sorted from lowest number to highest).  Note that the cell and its connections are only supplied for the GWF cells and their connections to the other GWF cells.  Also note that the JA list input may be divided such that every node and its connectivity list can be on a separate line for ease in readability of the file. To further ease readability of the file, the node number of the cell whose connectivity is subsequently listed, may be expressed as a negative number, the sign of which is subsequently converted to positive by the code. |
| GWF | DISU | CONNECTIONDATA | IHC | INTEGER (NJA) | is an index array indicating the direction between node n and all of its m connections.  If IHC = 0 then cell n and cell m are connected in the vertical direction.  Cell n overlies cell m if the cell number for n is less than m; cell m overlies cell n if the cell number for m is less than n.  If IHC = 1 then cell n and cell m are connected in the horizontal direction.  If IHC = 2 then cell n and cell m are connected in the horizontal direction, and the connection is vertically staggered.  A vertically staggered connection is one in which a cell is horizontally connected to more than one cell in a horizontal connection. |
| GWF | DISU | CONNECTIONDATA | CL12 | DOUBLE PRECISION (NJA) | is the array containing connection lengths between the center of cell n and the shared face with each adjacent m cell. |
| GWF | DISU | CONNECTIONDATA | HWVA | DOUBLE PRECISION (NJA) | is a symmetric array of size NJA.  For horizontal connections, entries in HWVA are the horizontal width perpendicular to flow.  For vertical connections, entries in HWVA are the vertical area for flow.  Thus, values in the HWVA array contain dimensions of both length and area.  Entries in the HWVA array have a one-to-one correspondence with the connections specified in the JA array.  Likewise, there is a one-to-one correspondence between entries in the HWVA array and entries in the IHC array, which specifies the connection type (horizontal or vertical).  Entries in the HWVA array must be symmetric; the program will terminate with an error if the value for HWVA for an n to m connection does not equal the value for HWVA for the corresponding n to m connection. |
| GWF | DISU | CONNECTIONDATA | ANGLDEGX | DOUBLE PRECISION (NJA) | is the angle (in degrees) between the horizontal x-axis and the outward normal to the face between a cell and its connecting cells. The angle varies between zero and 360.0 degrees, where zero degrees points in the positive x-axis direction, and 90 degrees points in the positive y-axis direction.  ANGLDEGX is only needed if horizontal anisotropy is specified in the NPF Package, if the XT3D option is used in the NPF Package, or if the SAVE\_SPECIFIC\_DISCHARGE option is specifed in the NPF Package.  ANGLDEGX does not need to be specified if these conditions are not met.  ANGLDEGX is of size NJA; values specified for vertical connections and for the diagonal position are not used.  Note that ANGLDEGX is read in degrees, which is different from MODFLOW-USG, which reads a similar variable (ANGLEX) in radians. |

| GWF | DISU | CELL2D | NCVERT | INTEGER | is the number of vertices required to define the cell.  There may be a different number of vertices for each cell. |
| GWF | DISU | CELL2D | ICVERT | INTEGER (NCVERT) | is an array of integer values containing vertex numbers (in the VERTICES block) used to define the cell.  Vertices must be listed in clockwise order. |
| GWF | IC | GRIDDATA | STRT | DOUBLE PRECISION (NODES) | is the initial (starting) head---that is, head at the beginning of the GWF Model simulation.  STRT must be specified for all simulations, including steady-state simulations. One value is read for every model cell. For simulations in which the first stress period is steady state, the values used for STRT generally do not affect the simulation (exceptions may occur if cells go dry and (or) rewet). The execution time, however, will be less if STRT includes hydraulic heads that are close to the steady-state solution.  A head value lower than the cell bottom can be provided if a cell should start as dry. |
| GWF | NPF | OPTIONS | SAVE_FLOWS | KEYWORD | keyword to indicate that budget flow terms will be written to the file specified with ``BUDGET SAVE FILE'' in Output Control. |
| GWF | NPF | OPTIONS | PRINT_FLOWS | KEYWORD | keyword to indicate that calculated flows between cells will be printed to the listing file for every stress period time step in which ``BUDGET PRINT'' is specified in Output Control. If there is no Output Control option and ``PRINT\_FLOWS'' is specified, then flow rates are printed for the last time step of each stress period.  This option can produce extremely large list files because all cell-by-cell flows are printed.  It should only be used with the NPF Package for models that have a small number of cells. |
| GWF | NPF | OPTIONS | ALTERNATIVE_CELL_AVERAGING | STRING | is a text keyword to indicate that an alternative method will be used for calculating the conductance for horizontal cell connections.  The text value for ALTERNATIVE\_CELL\_AVERAGING can be ``LOGARITHMIC'', ``AMT-LMK'', or ``AMT-HMK''.  ``AMT-LMK'' signifies that the conductance will be calculated using arithmetic-mean thickness and logarithmic-mean hydraulic conductivity.  ``AMT-HMK'' signifies that the conductance will be calculated using arithmetic-mean thickness and harmonic-mean hydraulic conductivity. If the user does not specify a value for ALTERNATIVE\_CELL\_AVERAGING, then the harmonic-mean method will be used.  This option cannot be used if the XT3D option is invoked. |
| GWF | NPF | OPTIONS | THICKSTRT | KEYWORD | indicates that cells having a negative ICELLTYPE are confined, and their cell thickness for conductance calculations will be computed as STRT-BOT rather than TOP-BOT.  This option should be used with caution as it only affects conductance calculations in the NPF Package. |
| GWF | NPF | OPTIONS | VARIABLECV | KEYWORD | keyword to indicate that the vertical conductance will be calculated using the saturated thickness and properties of the overlying cell and the thickness and properties of the underlying cell.  If the DEWATERED keyword is also specified, then the vertical conductance is calculated using only the saturated thickness and properties of the overlying cell if the head in the underlying cell is below its top.  If these keywords are not specified, then the default condition is to calculate the vertical conductance at the start of the simulation using the initial head and the cell properties.  The vertical conductance remains constant for the entire simulation. |
| GWF | NPF | OPTIONS | DEWATERED | KEYWORD | If the DEWATERED keyword is specified, then the vertical conductance is calculated using only the saturated thickness and properties of the overlying cell if the head in the underlying cell is below its top. |
| GWF | NPF | OPTIONS | PERCHED | KEYWORD | keyword to indicate that when a cell is overlying a dewatered convertible cell, the head difference used in Darcy's Law is equal to the head in the overlying cell minus the bottom elevation of the overlying cell.  If not specified, then the default is to use the head difference between the two cells. |
| GWF | NPF | OPTIONS | REWET | KEYWORD | activates model rewetting.  Rewetting is off by default. |
| GWF | NPF | OPTIONS | WETFCT | DOUBLE PRECISION | is a keyword and factor that is included in the calculation of the head that is initially established at a cell when that cell is converted from dry to wet. |
| GWF | NPF | OPTIONS | IWETIT | INTEGER | is a keyword and iteration interval for attempting to wet cells. Wetting is attempted every IWETIT iteration. This applies to outer iterations and not inner iterations. If IWETIT is specified as zero or less, then the value is changed to 1. |
| GWF | NPF | OPTIONS | IHDWET | INTEGER | is a keyword and integer flag that determines which equation is used to define the initial head at cells that become wet.  If IHDWET is 0, h = BOT + WETFCT (hm - BOT). If IHDWET is not 0, h = BOT + WETFCT (THRESH). |
| GWF | NPF | OPTIONS | XT3D | KEYWORD | keyword indicating that the XT3D formulation will be used.  If the RHS keyword is also included, then the XT3D additional terms will be added to the right-hand side.  If the RHS keyword is excluded, then the XT3D terms will be put into the coefficient matrix.  Use of XT3D will substantially increase the computational effort, but will result in improved accuracy for anisotropic conductivity fields and for unstructured grids in which the CVFD requirement is violated.  XT3D requires additional information about the shapes of grid cells.  If XT3D is active and the DISU Package is used, then the user will need to provide in the DISU Package the angldegx array in the CONNECTIONDATA block and the VERTICES and CELL2D blocks. |
| GWF | NPF | OPTIONS | RHS | KEYWORD | If the RHS keyword is also included, then the XT3D additional terms will be added to the right-hand side.  If the RHS keyword is excluded, then the XT3D terms will be put into the coefficient matrix. |
| GWF | NPF | OPTIONS | SAVE_SPECIFIC_DISCHARGE | KEYWORD | keyword to indicate that x, y, and z components of specific discharge will be calculated at cell centers and written to the budget file, which is specified with ``BUDGET SAVE FILE'' in Output Control.  If this option is activated, then additional information may be required in the discretization packages and the GWF Exchange package (if GWF models are coupled).  Specifically, ANGLDEGX must be specified in the CONNECTIONDATA block of the DISU Package; ANGLDEGX must also be specified for the GWF Exchange as an auxiliary variable. |
| GWF | NPF | OPTIONS | SAVE_SATURATION | KEYWORD | keyword to indicate that cell saturation will be written to the budget file, which is specified with ``BUDGET SAVE FILE'' in Output Control.  Saturation will be saved to the budget file as an auxiliary variable saved with the DATA-SAT text label.  Saturation is a cell variable that ranges from zero to one and can be used by post processing programs to determine how much of a cell volume is saturated.  If ICELLTYPE is 0, then saturation is always one. |
| GWF | NPF | OPTIONS | K22OVERK | KEYWORD | keyword to indicate that specified K22 is a ratio of K22 divided by K.  If this option is specified, then the K22 array entered in the NPF Package will be multiplied by K after being read. |
| GWF | NPF | OPTIONS | K33OVERK | KEYWORD | keyword to indicate that specified K33 is a ratio of K33 divided by K.  If this option is specified, then the K33 array entered in the NPF Package will be multiplied by K after being read. |
| GWF | NPF | OPTIONS | TVK6 | KEYWORD | keyword to specify that record corresponds to a time-varying hydraulic conductivity (TVK) file.  The behavior of TVK and a description of the input file is provided separately. |
| GWF | NPF | OPTIONS | FILEIN | KEYWORD | keyword to specify that an input filename is expected next. |
| GWF | NPF | OPTIONS | TVK6_FILENAME | STRING | defines a time-varying hydraulic conductivity (TVK) input file.  Records in the TVK file can be used to change hydraulic conductivity properties at specified times or stress periods. |
| GWF | NPF | OPTIONS | DEV_NO_NEWTON | KEYWORD | turn off Newton for unconfined cells |
| GWF | NPF | OPTIONS | DEV_MODFLOWUSG_UPSTREAM_WEIGHTED_SATURATION | KEYWORD | use MODFLOW-USG upstream-weighted saturation approach |

| GWF | NPF | OPTIONS | DEV_MINIMUM_SATURATED_THICKNESS | DOUBLE PRECISION | set minimum allowed saturated thickness |
| GWF | NPF | OPTIONS | DEV_OMEGA | DOUBLE PRECISION | set saturation omega value |
| GWF | NPF | GRIDDATA | ICELLTYPE | INTEGER (NODES) | flag for each cell that specifies how saturated thickness is treated.  0 means saturated thickness is held constant;  $>$0 means saturated thickness varies with computed head when head is below the cell top; $<$0 means saturated thickness varies with computed head unless the THICKSTRT option is in effect.  When THICKSTRT is in effect, a negative value for ICELLTYPE indicates that the saturated thickness value used in conductance calculations in the NPF Package will be computed as STRT-BOT and held constant.  If the THICKSTRT option is not in effect, then negative values provided by the user for ICELLTYPE are automatically reassigned by the program to a value of one. |
| GWF | NPF | GRIDDATA | K | DOUBLE PRECISION (NODES) | is the hydraulic conductivity.  For the common case in which the user would like to specify the horizontal hydraulic conductivity and the vertical hydraulic conductivity, then K should be assigned as the horizontal hydraulic conductivity, K33 should be assigned as the vertical hydraulic conductivity, and K22 and the three rotation angles should not be specified.  When more sophisticated anisotropy is required, then K corresponds to the K11 hydraulic conductivity axis.  All included cells (IDOMAIN $>$ 0) must have a K value greater than zero. |
| GWF | NPF | GRIDDATA | K22 | DOUBLE PRECISION (NODES) | is the hydraulic conductivity of the second ellipsoid axis (or the ratio of K22/K if the K22OVERK option is specified); for an unrotated case this is the hydraulic conductivity in the y direction.  If K22 is not included in the GRIDDATA block, then K22 is set equal to K.  For a regular MODFLOW grid (DIS Package is used) in which no rotation angles are specified, K22 is the hydraulic conductivity along columns in the y direction. For an unstructured DISU grid, the user must assign principal x and y axes and provide the angle for each cell face relative to the assigned x direction.  All included cells (IDOMAIN $>$ 0) must have a K22 value greater than zero. |
| GWF | NPF | GRIDDATA | K33 | DOUBLE PRECISION (NODES) | is the hydraulic conductivity of the third ellipsoid axis (or the ratio of K33/K if the K33OVERK option is specified); for an unrotated case, this is the vertical hydraulic conductivity.  When anisotropy is applied, K33 corresponds to the K33 tensor component.  All included cells (IDOMAIN $>$ 0) must have a K33 value greater than zero. |
| GWF | NPF | GRIDDATA | ANGLE1 | DOUBLE PRECISION (NODES) | is a rotation angle of the hydraulic conductivity tensor in degrees. The angle represents the first of three sequential rotations of the hydraulic conductivity ellipsoid. With the K11, K22, and K33 axes of the ellipsoid initially aligned with the x, y, and z coordinate axes, respectively, ANGLE1 rotates the ellipsoid about its K33 axis (within the x - y plane). A positive value represents counter-clockwise rotation when viewed from any point on the positive K33 axis, looking toward the center of the ellipsoid. A value of zero indicates that the K11 axis lies within the x - z plane. If ANGLE1 is not specified, default values of zero are assigned to ANGLE1, ANGLE2, and ANGLE3, in which case the K11, K22, and K33 axes are aligned with the x, y, and z axes, respectively. |
| GWF | NPF | GRIDDATA | ANGLE2 | DOUBLE PRECISION (NODES) | is a rotation angle of the hydraulic conductivity tensor in degrees. The angle represents the second of three sequential rotations of the hydraulic conductivity ellipsoid. Following the rotation by ANGLE1 described above, ANGLE2 rotates the ellipsoid about its K22 axis (out of the x - y plane). An array can be specified for ANGLE2 only if ANGLE1 is also specified. A positive value of ANGLE2 represents clockwise rotation when viewed from any point on the positive K22 axis, looking toward the center of the ellipsoid. A value of zero indicates that the K11 axis lies within the x - y plane. If ANGLE2 is not specified, default values of zero are assigned to ANGLE2 and ANGLE3; connections that are not user-designated as vertical are assumed to be strictly horizontal (that is, to have no z component to their orientation); and connection lengths are based on horizontal distances. |
| GWF | NPF | GRIDDATA | ANGLE3 | DOUBLE PRECISION (NODES) | is a rotation angle of the hydraulic conductivity tensor in degrees. The angle represents the third of three sequential rotations of the hydraulic conductivity ellipsoid. Following the rotations by ANGLE1 and ANGLE2 described above, ANGLE3 rotates the ellipsoid about its K11 axis. An array can be specified for ANGLE3 only if ANGLE1 and ANGLE2 are also specified. An array must be specified for ANGLE3 if ANGLE2 is specified. A positive value of ANGLE3 represents clockwise rotation when viewed from any point on the positive K11 axis, looking toward the center of the ellipsoid. A value of zero indicates that the K22 axis lies within the x - y plane. |
| GWF | NPF | GRIDDATA | WETDRY | DOUBLE PRECISION (NODES) | is a combination of the wetting threshold and a flag to indicate which neighboring cells can cause a cell to become wet. If WETDRY $<$ 0, only a cell below a dry cell can cause the cell to become wet. If WETDRY $>$ 0, the cell below a dry cell and horizontally adjacent cells can cause a cell to become wet. If WETDRY is 0, the cell cannot be wetted. The absolute value of WETDRY is the wetting threshold. When the sum of BOT and the absolute value of WETDRY at a dry cell is equaled or exceeded by the head at an adjacent cell, the cell is wetted.  WETDRY must be specified if ``REWET'' is specified in the OPTIONS block.  If ``REWET'' is not specified in the options block, then WETDRY can be entered, and memory will be allocated for it, even though it is not used. |
| GWF | BUY | OPTIONS | HHFORMULATION_RHS | KEYWORD | use the variable-density hydraulic head formulation and add off-diagonal terms to the right-hand.  This option will prevent the BUY Package from adding asymmetric terms to the flow matrix. |

| GWF | BUY | OPTIONS | DEV_EFH_FORMULATION | KEYWORD | use the variable-density equivalent freshwater head formulation instead of the hydraulic head head formulation.  This dev option has only been implemented for confined aquifer conditions and should generally not be used. |
| GWF | BUY | DIMENSIONS | NRHOSPECIES | INTEGER | number of species used in density equation of state.  This value must be one or greater if the BUY package is activated. |
| GWF | BUY | PACKAGEDATA | IRHOSPEC | INTEGER | integer value that defines the species number associated with the specified PACKAGEDATA data on the line. IRHOSPECIES must be greater than zero and less than or equal to NRHOSPECIES. Information must be specified for each of the NRHOSPECIES species or the program will terminate with an error.  The program will also terminate with an error if information for a species is specified more than once. |

| GWF | BUY | PACKAGEDATA | MODELNAME | STRING | name of GWT model used to simulate a species that will be used in the density equation of state.  This name will have no effect if the simulation does not include a GWT model that corresponds to this GWF model. |
| GWF | BUY | PACKAGEDATA | AUXSPECIESNAME | STRING | name of an auxiliary variable in a GWF stress package that will be used for this species to calculate a density value.  If a density value is needed by the Buoyancy Package then it will use the concentration values in this AUXSPECIESNAME column in the density equation of state.  For advanced stress packages (LAK, SFR, MAW, and UZF) that have an associated advanced transport package (LKT, SFT, MWT, and UZT), the FLOW\_PACKAGE\_AUXILIARY\_NAME option in the advanced transport package can be used to transfer simulated concentrations into the flow package auxiliary variable.  In this manner, the Buoyancy Package can calculate density values for lakes, streams, multi-aquifer wells, and unsaturated zone flow cells using simulated concentrations. |

| GWF | STO | OPTIONS | SS_CONFINED_ONLY | KEYWORD | keyword to indicate that compressible storage is only calculated for a convertible cell (ICONVERT>0) when the cell is under confined conditions (head greater than or equal to the top of the cell). This option has no effect on cells that are marked as being always confined (ICONVERT=0).  This option is identical to the approach used to calculate storage changes under confined conditions in MODFLOW-2005. |
| GWF | STO | OPTIONS | TVS6 | KEYWORD | keyword to specify that record corresponds to a time-varying storage (TVS) file.  The behavior of TVS and a description of the input file is provided separately. |

| GWF | STO | GRIDDATA | ICONVERT | INTEGER (NODES) | is a flag for each cell that specifies whether or not a cell is convertible for the storage calculation. 0 indicates confined storage is used. $>$0 indicates confined storage is used when head is above cell top and a mixed formulation of unconfined and confined storage is used when head is below cell top. |
| GWF | STO | GRIDDATA | SS | DOUBLE PRECISION (NODES) | is specific storage (or the storage coefficient if STORAGECOEFFICIENT is specified as an option). Specific storage values must be greater than or equal to 0. If the CSUB Package is included in the GWF model, specific storage must be zero for every cell. |
| GWF | STO | GRIDDATA | SY | DOUBLE PRECISION (NODES) | is specific yield. Specific yield values must be greater than or equal to 0. Specific yield does not have to be specified if there are no convertible cells (ICONVERT=0 in every cell). |
| GWF | STO | PERIOD | IPER | INTEGER | integer value specifying the starting stress period number for which the data specified in the PERIOD block apply.  IPER must be less than or equal to NPER in the TDIS Package and greater than zero.  The IPER value assigned to a stress period block must be greater than the IPER value assigned for the previous PERIOD block.  The information specified in the PERIOD block will continue to apply for all subsequent stress periods, unless the program encounters another PERIOD block. |
| GWF | STO | PERIOD | STEADY-STATE | KEYWORD | keyword to indicate that stress period IPER is steady-state. Steady-state conditions will apply until the TRANSIENT keyword is specified in a subsequent BEGIN PERIOD block. If the CSUB Package is included in the GWF model, only the first and last stress period can be steady-state. |
| GWF | STO | PERIOD | TRANSIENT | KEYWORD | keyword to indicate that stress period IPER is transient. Transient conditions will apply until the STEADY-STATE keyword is specified in a subsequent BEGIN PERIOD block. |

| GWF | CSUB | OPTIONS | BETA | DOUBLE PRECISION | compressibility of water. Typical values of BETA are 4.6512e-10 1/Pa or 2.2270e-8 lb/square foot in SI and English units, respectively. By default, BETA is 4.6512e-10 1/Pa. |
| GWF | CSUB | OPTIONS | HEAD_BASED | KEYWORD | keyword to indicate the head-based formulation will be used to simulate coarse-grained aquifer materials and no-delay and delay interbeds. Specifying HEAD\_BASED also specifies the INITIAL\_PRECONSOLIDATION\_HEAD option. |
| GWF | CSUB | OPTIONS | INITIAL_PRECONSOLIDATION_HEAD | KEYWORD | keyword to indicate that preconsolidation heads will be specified for no-delay and delay interbeds in the PACKAGEDATA block. If the SPECIFIED\_INITIAL\_INTERBED\_STATE option is specified in the OPTIONS block, user-specified preconsolidation heads in the PACKAGEDATA block are absolute values. Otherwise, user-specified preconsolidation heads in the PACKAGEDATA block are relative to steady-state or initial heads. |
| GWF | CSUB | OPTIONS | NDELAYCELLS | INTEGER | number of nodes used to discretize delay interbeds. If not specified, then a default value of 19 is assigned. |
| GWF | CSUB | OPTIONS | COMPRESSION_INDICES | KEYWORD | keyword to indicate that the recompression (CR) and compression (CC) indices are specified instead of the elastic specific storage (SSE) and inelastic specific storage (SSV) coefficients.

The SPECIFIED\_INITIAL\_INTERBED\_STATE option is equivalent to specifying the SPECIFIED\_INITIAL\_PRECONSOLITATION\_STRESS and SPECIFIED\_INITIAL\_DELAY\_HEAD. If SPECIFIED\_INITIAL\_INTERBED\_STATE is not specified then preconsolidation stress (head) and delay bed head values specified in the PACKAGEDATA block are relative to simulated values of the first stress period if steady-state or initial stresses and GWF heads if the first stress period is transient. |
| GWF | CSUB | OPTIONS | SPECIFIED_INITIAL_PRECONSOLIDATION_STRESS | KEYWORD | keyword to indicate that absolute preconsolidation stresses (heads) will be specified for interbeds defined in the PACKAGEDATA block. If SPECIFIED\_INITIAL\_PRECONSOLITATION\_STRESS and SPECIFIED\_INITIAL\_INTERBED\_STATE are not specified then preconsolidation stress (head) values specified in the PACKAGEDATA block are relative to simulated values if the first stress period is steady-state or initial stresses (heads) if the first stress period is transient. |
| GWF | CSUB | OPTIONS | SPECIFIED_INITIAL_DELAY_HEAD | KEYWORD | keyword to indicate that absolute initial delay bed head will be specified for interbeds defined in the PACKAGEDATA block. If SPECIFIED\_INITIAL\_DELAY\_HEAD and SPECIFIED\_INITIAL\_INTERBED\_STATE are not specified then delay bed head values specified in the PACKAGEDATA block are relative to simulated values if the first stress period is steady-state or initial GWF heads if the first stress period is transient. |
| GWF | CSUB | OPTIONS | EFFECTIVE_STRESS_LAG | KEYWORD | keyword to indicate the effective stress from the previous time step will be used to calculate specific storage values. This option can 1) help with convergence in models with thin cells and water table elevations close to land surface; 2) is identical to the approach used in the SUBWT package for MODFLOW-2005; and 3) is only used if the effective-stress formulation is being used. By default, current effective stress values are used to calculate specific storage values. |

For a structured grid that uses the DIS input file, CELLID is the layer, row, and column.   For a grid that uses the DISV input file, CELLID is the layer and CELL2D number.  If the model uses the unstructured discretization (DISU) input file, CELLID is the node number for the cell. |

The program will terminate with an error condition if CONDEQN is SKIN or CUMULATIVE and the calculated saturated conductance is less than zero; if an error condition occurs, it is suggested that the THEIM or MEAN conductance equations be used for these multi-aquifer wells. |

The values of auxiliary variables must be present for each multi-aquifer well. The values must be specified in the order of the auxiliary variables specified in the OPTIONS block.  If the package supports time series and the Options block includes a TIMESERIESFILE entry (see the ``Time-Variable Input'' section), values can be obtained from a time series by entering the time-series name in place of a numeric value. |
| GWF | MAW | PACKAGEDATA | BOUNDNAME | STRING | name of the multi-aquifer well cell.  BOUNDNAME is an ASCII character variable that can contain as many as 40 characters.  If BOUNDNAME contains spaces in it, then the entire name must be enclosed within single quotes. |

WELLNO must be greater than zero and less than or equal to NMAWWELLS. Multi-aquifer well connection information must be specified for every multi-aquifer well connection to the GWF model (NGWFNODES) or the program will terminate with an error.

| GWF | MAW | CONNECTIONDATA | CELLID | INTEGER (NCELLDIM) | is the cell identifier, and depends on the type of grid that is used for the simulation.  For a structured grid that uses the DIS input file, CELLID is the layer, row, and column.   For a grid that uses the DISV input file, CELLID is the layer and CELL2D number.  If the model uses the unstructured discretization (DISU) input file, CELLID is the node number for the cell. One or more screened intervals can be connected to the same CELLID if CONDEQN for a well is MEAN. The program will terminate with an error if MAW wells using SPECIFIED, THIEM, SKIN, or CUMULATIVE conductance equations have more than one connection to the same CELLID. |
| GWF | MAW | CONNECTIONDATA | SCRN_TOP | DOUBLE PRECISION | value that defines the top elevation of the screen for the multi-aquifer well connection. If CONDEQN is SPECIFIED, THIEM, SKIN, or COMPOSITE, SCRN\_TOP can be any value and is set to the top of the cell. If CONDEQN is MEAN, SCRN\_TOP is set to the multi-aquifer well connection cell top if the specified value is greater than the cell top. The program will terminate with an error if the screen top is less than the screen bottom. |

If CONDEQN is SPECIFIED, THIEM, SKIN, or COMPOSITE, SCRN\_BOT can be any value is set to the bottom of the cell. If CONDEQN is MEAN, SCRN\_BOT is set to the multi-aquifer well connection cell bottom if the specified value is less than the cell bottom.

| GWF | MAW | CONNECTIONDATA | HK_SKIN | DOUBLE PRECISION | value that defines the skin (filter pack) hydraulic conductivity (if CONDEQN for the multi-aquifer well is SKIN, CUMULATIVE, or MEAN) or conductance (if CONDEQN for the multi-aquifer well is SPECIFIED) for each GWF node connected to the multi-aquifer well (NGWFNODES). If CONDEQN is SPECIFIED, HK\_SKIN must be greater than or equal to zero.  HK\_SKIN can be any value if CONDEQN is THIEM. Otherwise, HK\_SKIN must be greater than zero. If CONDEQN is SKIN, the contrast between the cell transmissivity (the product of geometric mean horizontal hydraulic conductivity and the cell thickness) and the well transmissivity (the product of HK\_SKIN and the screen thicknesses) must be greater than one in node CELLID or the program will terminate with an error condition; if an error condition occurs, it is suggested that the HK\_SKIN be reduced to a value less than K11 and K22 in node CELLID or the THEIM or MEAN conductance equations be used for these multi-aquifer wells. |
| GWF | MAW | CONNECTIONDATA | RADIUS_SKIN | DOUBLE PRECISION | real value that defines the skin radius (filter pack radius) for the multi-aquifer well. RADIUS\_SKIN can be any value if CONDEQN is SPECIFIED or THIEM.

| GWF | MAW | PERIOD | IPER | INTEGER | integer value specifying the starting stress period number for which the data specified in the PERIOD block apply.  IPER must be less than or equal to NPER in the TDIS Package and greater than zero.  The IPER value assigned to a stress period block must be greater than the IPER value assigned for the previous PERIOD block.  The information specified in the PERIOD block will continue to apply for all subsequent stress periods, unless the program encounters another PERIOD block. |

| GWF | MAW | PERIOD | FWELEV | DOUBLE PRECISION | elevation used to determine whether or not the well is flowing. |
| GWF | MAW | PERIOD | FWCOND | DOUBLE PRECISION | conductance used to calculate the discharge of a free flowing well.  Flow occurs when the head in the well is above the well top elevation (FWELEV). |
| GWF | MAW | PERIOD | FWRLEN | DOUBLE PRECISION | length used to reduce the conductance of the flowing well.  When the head in the well drops below the well top plus the reduction length, then the conductance is reduced.  This reduction length can be used to improve the stability of simulations with flowing wells so that there is not an abrupt change in flowing well rates. |
| GWF | MAW | PERIOD | RATE | DOUBLE PRECISION | is the volumetric pumping rate for the multi-aquifer well. A positive value indicates recharge and a negative value indicates discharge (pumping). RATE only applies to active (IBOUND $>$ 0) multi-aquifer wells. If the Options block includes a TIMESERIESFILE entry (see the ``Time-Variable Input'' section), values can be obtained from a time series by entering the time-series name in place of a numeric value. By default, the RATE for each multi-aquifer well is zero. |
| GWF | MAW | PERIOD | WELL_HEAD | DOUBLE PRECISION | is the head in the multi-aquifer well. WELL\_HEAD is only applied to constant head (STATUS is CONSTANT) and inactive (STATUS is INACTIVE) multi-aquifer wells. If the Options block includes a TIMESERIESFILE entry (see the ``Time-Variable Input'' section), values can be obtained from a time series by entering the time-series name in place of a numeric value. The program will terminate with an error if WELL\_HEAD is less than the bottom of the well. |
| GWF | MAW | PERIOD | HEAD_LIMIT | STRING | is the limiting water level (head) in the well, which is the minimum of the well RATE or the well inflow rate from the aquifer. HEAD\_LIMIT can be applied to extraction wells (RATE $<$ 0) or injection wells (RATE $>$ 0). HEAD\_LIMIT can be deactivated by specifying the text string `OFF'. The HEAD\_LIMIT option is based on the HEAD\_LIMIT functionality available in the MNW2~\citep{konikow2009} package for MODFLOW-2005. The HEAD\_LIMIT option has been included to facilitate backward compatibility with previous versions of MODFLOW but use of the RATE\_SCALING option instead of the HEAD\_LIMIT option is recommended. By default, HEAD\_LIMIT is `OFF'. |
| GWF | MAW | PERIOD | SHUT_OFF | KEYWORD | keyword for activating well shut off capability.  Subsequent values define the minimum and maximum pumping rate that a well must exceed to shutoff or reactivate a well, respectively, during a stress period. SHUT\_OFF is only applied to injection wells (RATE$<0$) and if HEAD\_LIMIT is specified (not set to `OFF').  If HEAD\_LIMIT is specified, SHUT\_OFF can be deactivated by specifying a minimum value equal to zero. The SHUT\_OFF option is based on the SHUT\_OFF functionality available in the MNW2~\citep{konikow2009} package for MODFLOW-2005. The SHUT\_OFF option has been included to facilitate backward compatibility with previous versions of MODFLOW but use of the RATE\_SCALING option instead of the SHUT\_OFF option is recommended. By default, SHUT\_OFF is not used. |
| GWF | MAW | PERIOD | MINRATE | DOUBLE PRECISION | is the minimum rate that a well must exceed to shutoff a well during a stress period. The well will shut down during a time step if the flow rate to the well from the aquifer is less than MINRATE. If a well is shut down during a time step, reactivation of the well cannot occur until the next time step to reduce oscillations. MINRATE must be less than maxrate. |
| GWF | MAW | PERIOD | MAXRATE | DOUBLE PRECISION | is the maximum rate that a well must exceed to reactivate a well during a stress period. The well will reactivate during a timestep if the well was shutdown during the previous time step and the flow rate to the well from the aquifer exceeds maxrate. Reactivation of the well cannot occur until the next time step if a well is shutdown to reduce oscillations. maxrate must be greater than MINRATE. |
| GWF | MAW | PERIOD | RATE_SCALING | KEYWORD | activate rate scaling.  If RATE\_SCALING is specified, both PUMP\_ELEVATION and SCALING\_LENGTH must be specified. RATE\_SCALING cannot be used with HEAD\_LIMIT.  RATE\_SCALING can be used for extraction or injection wells.  For extraction wells, the extraction rate will start to decrease once the head in the well lowers to a level equal to the pump elevation plus the scaling length.  If the head in the well drops below the pump elevation, then the extraction rate is calculated to be zero.  For an injection well, the injection rate will begin to decrease once the head in the well rises above the specified pump elevation.  If the head in the well rises above the pump elevation plus the scaling length, then the injection rate will be set to zero. |
| GWF | MAW | PERIOD | PUMP_ELEVATION | DOUBLE PRECISION | is the elevation of the multi-aquifer well pump (PUMP\_ELEVATION).  PUMP\_ELEVATION should not be less than the bottom elevation (BOTTOM) of the multi-aquifer well. |
| GWF | MAW | PERIOD | SCALING_LENGTH | DOUBLE PRECISION | height above the pump elevation (SCALING\_LENGTH).  If the simulated well head is below this elevation (pump elevation plus the scaling length), then the pumping rate is reduced. |

| GWF | SFR | OPTIONS | AUXILIARY | STRING (NAUX) | defines an array of one or more auxiliary variable names.  There is no limit on the number of auxiliary variables that can be provided on this line; however, lists of information provided in subsequent blocks must have a column of data for each auxiliary variable name defined here.   The number of auxiliary variables detected on this line determines the value for naux.  Comments cannot be provided anywhere on this line as they will be interpreted as auxiliary variable names.  Auxiliary variables may not be used by the package, but they will be available for use by other parts of the program.  The program will terminate with an error if auxiliary variables are specified on more than one line in the options block. |

| GWF | SFR | OPTIONS | MAXIMUM_PICARD_ITERATIONS | INTEGER | integer value that defines the maximum number of Streamflow Routing picard iterations allowed when solving for reach stages and flows as part of the GWF formulate step. Picard iterations are used to minimize differences in SFR package results between subsequent GWF picard (non-linear) iterations as a result of non-optimal reach numbering. If reaches are numbered in order, from upstream to downstream, MAXIMUM\_PICARD\_ITERATIONS can be set to 1 to reduce model run time. By default, MAXIMUM\_PICARD\_ITERATIONS is equal to 100. |
| GWF | SFR | OPTIONS | MAXIMUM_ITERATIONS | INTEGER | integer value that defines the maximum number of Streamflow Routing Newton-Raphson iterations allowed for a reach. By default, MAXIMUM\_ITERATIONS is equal to 100. MAXIMUM\_ITERATIONS would only need to be increased from the default value if one or more reach in a simulation has a large water budget error. |
| GWF | SFR | OPTIONS | MAXIMUM_DEPTH_CHANGE | DOUBLE PRECISION | real value that defines the depth closure tolerance. By default, MAXIMUM\_DEPTH\_CHANGE is equal to $1 \times 10^{-5}$.

RNO must be greater than zero and less than or equal to NREACHES. Reach information must be specified for every reach or the program will terminate with an error.  The program will also terminate with an error if information for a reach is specified more than once. |
| GWF | SFR | PACKAGEDATA | CELLID | INTEGER (NCELLDIM) | is the cell identifier, and depends on the type of grid that is used for the simulation. For a structured grid that uses the DIS input file, CELLID is the layer, row, and column. For a grid that uses the DISV input file, CELLID is the layer and CELL2D number. If the model uses the unstructured discretization (DISU) input file, CELLID is the node number for the cell. For reaches that are not connected to an underlying GWF cell, a zero should be specified for each grid dimension. For example, for a DIS grid a CELLID of 0 0 0 should be specified. Reach-aquifer flow is not calculated for unconnected reaches. The keyword NONE can be still be specified to identify unconnected reaches for backward compatibility with previous versions of MODFLOW 6 but eventually NONE will be deprecated and will cause MODFLOW 6 to terminate with an error. |

Positive IC numbers indicate connected reaches are connected to the upstream end of the current reach. The absolute value of IC must be greater than zero and less than or equal to NREACHES. IC should not be specified when NCON is zero but must be specified otherwise. |
| GWF | SFR | DIVERSIONS | RNO | INTEGER | integer value that defines the reach number associated with the specified DIVERSIONS data on the line. RNO must be greater than zero and less than or equal to NREACHES.  Reach diversion information must be specified for every reach with a NDV value greater than 0 or the program will terminate with an error.  The program will also terminate with an error if diversion information for a given reach diversion is specified more than once. |
| GWF | SFR | DIVERSIONS | IDV | INTEGER | integer value that defines the downstream diversion number for the diversion for reach RNO. IDV must be greater than zero and less than or equal to NDV for reach RNO. |
| GWF | SFR | DIVERSIONS | ICONR | INTEGER | integer value that defines the downstream reach that will receive the diverted water. IDV must be greater than zero and less than or equal to NREACHES. Furthermore, reach  ICONR must be a downstream connection for reach RNO. |
| GWF | SFR | DIVERSIONS | CPRIOR | STRING | character string value that defines the the prioritization system for the diversion, such as when insufficient water is available to meet all diversion stipulations, and is used in conjunction with the value of FLOW value specified in the STRESS\_PERIOD\_DATA section. Available diversion options include:  (1) CPRIOR = `FRACTION', then the amount of the diversion is computed as a fraction of the streamflow leaving reach RNO ($Q_{DS}$); in this case, 0.0 $\le$ DIVFLOW $\le$ 1.0.  (2) CPRIOR = `EXCESS', a diversion is made only if $Q_{DS}$ for reach RNO exceeds the value of DIVFLOW. If this occurs, then the quantity of water diverted is the excess flow ($Q_{DS} -$ DIVFLOW) and $Q_{DS}$ from reach RNO is set equal to DIVFLOW. This represents a flood-control type of diversion, as described by Danskin and Hanson (2002). (3) CPRIOR = `THRESHOLD', then if $Q_{DS}$ in reach RNO is less than the specified diversion flow DIVFLOW, no water is diverted from reach RNO. If $Q_{DS}$ in reach RNO is greater than or equal to DIVFLOW, DIVFLOW is diverted and $Q_{DS}$ is set to the remainder ($Q_{DS} -$ DIVFLOW)). This approach assumes that once flow in the stream is sufficiently low, diversions from the stream cease, and is the `priority' algorithm that originally was programmed into the STR1 Package (Prudic, 1989).  (4) CPRIOR = `UPTO' -- if $Q_{DS}$ in reach RNO is greater than or equal to the specified diversion flow DIVFLOW, $Q_{DS}$ is reduced by DIVFLOW. If $Q_{DS}$ in reach RNO is less than DIVFLOW, DIVFLOW is set to $Q_{DS}$ and there will be no flow available for reaches connected to downstream end of reach RNO. |
| GWF | SFR | PERIOD | IPER | INTEGER | integer value specifying the starting stress period number for which the data specified in the PERIOD block apply.  IPER must be less than or equal to NPER in the TDIS Package and greater than zero.  The IPER value assigned to a stress period block must be greater than the IPER value assigned for the previous PERIOD block.  The information specified in the PERIOD block will continue to apply for all subsequent stress periods, unless the program encounters another PERIOD block. |
| GWF | SFR | PERIOD | RNO | INTEGER | integer value that defines the reach number associated with the specified PERIOD data on the line. RNO must be greater than zero and less than or equal to NREACHES. |
| GWF | SFR | PERIOD | SFRSETTING | KEYSTRING | line of information that is parsed into a keyword and values.  Keyword values that can be used to start the SFRSETTING string include: STATUS, MANNING, STAGE, INFLOW, RAINFALL, EVAPORATION, RUNOFF, DIVERSION, UPSTREAM\_FRACTION, and AUXILIARY. |
| GWF | SFR | PERIOD | STATUS | STRING | keyword option to define stream reach status.  STATUS can be ACTIVE, INACTIVE, or SIMPLE. The SIMPLE STATUS option simulates streamflow using a user-specified stage for a reach or a stage set to the top of the reach (depth = 0). In cases where the simulated leakage calculated using the specified stage exceeds the sum of inflows to the reach, the stage is set to the top of the reach and leakage is set equal to the sum of inflows. Upstream fractions should be changed using the UPSTREAM\_FRACTION SFRSETTING if the status for one or more reaches is changed to ACTIVE or INACTIVE. For example, if one of two downstream connections for a reach is inactivated, the upstream fraction for the active and inactive downstream reach should be changed to 1.0 and 0.0, respectively, to ensure that the active reach receives all of the downstream outflow from the upstream reach. By default, STATUS is ACTIVE. |
| GWF | SFR | PERIOD | MANNING | STRING | real or character value that defines the Manning's roughness coefficient for the reach. MANNING must be greater than zero.  If the Options block includes a TIMESERIESFILE entry (see the ``Time-Variable Input'' section), values can be obtained from a time series by entering the time-series name in place of a numeric value. |
| GWF | SFR | PERIOD | STAGE | STRING | real or character value that defines the stage for the reach. The specified STAGE is only applied if the reach uses the simple routing option. If STAGE is not specified for reaches that use the simple routing option, the specified stage is set to the top of the reach. If the Options block includes a TIMESERIESFILE entry (see the ``Time-Variable Input'' section), values can be obtained from a time series by entering the time-series name in place of a numeric value. |
| GWF | SFR | PERIOD | INFLOW | STRING | real or character value that defines the volumetric inflow rate for the streamflow routing reach. If the Options block includes a TIMESERIESFILE entry (see the ``Time-Variable Input'' section), values can be obtained from a time series by entering the time-series name in place of a numeric value. By default, inflow rates are zero for each reach. |
| GWF | SFR | PERIOD | RAINFALL | STRING | real or character value that defines the  volumetric rate per unit area of water added by precipitation directly on the streamflow routing reach. If the Options block includes a TIMESERIESFILE entry (see the ``Time-Variable Input'' section), values can be obtained from a time series by entering the time-series name in place of a numeric value. By default, rainfall  rates are zero for each reach. |
| GWF | SFR | PERIOD | EVAPORATION | STRING | real or character value that defines the volumetric rate per unit area of water subtracted by evaporation from the streamflow routing reach. A positive evaporation rate should be provided. If the Options block includes a TIMESERIESFILE entry (see the ``Time-Variable Input'' section), values can be obtained from a time series by entering the time-series name in place of a numeric value.

| GWF | MVR | PERIOD | ID1 | INTEGER | is the identifier for the provider.  For the standard boundary packages, the provider identifier is the number of the boundary as it is listed in the package input file. (Note that the order of these boundaries may change by stress period, which must be accounted for in the Mover Package.)  So the first well has an identifier of one.  The second is two, and so forth.  For the advanced packages, the identifier is the reach number (SFR Package), well number (MAW Package), or UZF cell number.  For the Lake Package, ID1 is the lake outlet number.  Thus, outflows from a single lake can be routed to different streams, for example. |
| GWF | MVR | PERIOD | MNAME2 | STRING | name of model containing the package, PNAME2. |
| GWF | MVR | PERIOD | PNAME2 | STRING | is the package name for the receiver.  The package PNAME2 must be designated to receive water from the MVR Package by specifying the keyword ``MOVER'' in its OPTIONS block. |
| GWF | MVR | PERIOD | ID2 | INTEGER | is the identifier for the receiver.  The receiver identifier is the reach number (SFR Package), Lake number (LAK Package), well number (MAW Package), or UZF cell number. |
| GWF | MVR | PERIOD | MVRTYPE | STRING | is the character string signifying the method for determining how much water will be moved.

| GWF | GNC | OPTIONS | EXPLICIT | KEYWORD | keyword to indicate that the ghost node correction is applied in an explicit manner on the right-hand side of the matrix.  The explicit approach will likely require additional outer iterations.  If the keyword is not specified, then the correction will be applied in an implicit manner on the left-hand side.  The implicit approach will likely converge better, but may require additional memory.  If the EXPLICIT keyword is not specified, then the BICGSTAB linear acceleration option should be specified within the LINEAR block of the Sparse Matrix Solver. |
| GWF | GNC | DIMENSIONS | NUMGNC | INTEGER | is the number of GNC entries. |
| GWF | GNC | DIMENSIONS | NUMALPHAJ | INTEGER | is the number of contributing factors. |
| GWF | GNC | GNCDATA | CELLIDN | INTEGER | is the cellid of the cell, $n$, in which the ghost node is located.

If the model uses the unstructured discretization (DISU) input file, then CELLIDN is the node number for the cell. |
| GWF | GNC | GNCDATA | CELLIDM | INTEGER | is the cellid of the connecting cell, $m$, to which flow occurs from the ghost node. For a structured grid that uses the DIS input file, CELLIDM is the layer, row, and column numbers of the cell.   For a grid that uses the DISV input file, CELLIDM is the layer number and CELL2D number for the two cells.  If the model uses the unstructured discretization (DISU) input file, then CELLIDM is the node number for the cell. |
| GWF | GNC | GNCDATA | CELLIDSJ | INTEGER (NUMALPHAJ) | is the array of CELLIDS for the contributing j cells, which contribute to the interpolated head value at the ghost node. This item contains one CELLID for each of the contributing cells of the ghost node. Note that if the number of actual contributing cells needed by the user is less than NUMALPHAJ for any ghost node, then a dummy CELLID of zero(s) should be inserted with an associated contributing factor of zero. For a structured grid that uses the DIS input file, CELLID is the layer, row, and column numbers of the cell.   For a grid that uses the DISV input file, CELLID is the layer number and cell2d number for the two cells.  If the model uses the unstructured discretization (DISU) input file, then CELLID is the node number for the cell. |
| GWF | GNC | GNCDATA | ALPHASJ | DOUBLE PRECISION (NUMALPHAJ) | is the contributing factors for each contributing node in CELLIDSJ. Note that if the number of actual contributing cells is less than NUMALPHAJ for any ghost node, then dummy CELLIDS should be inserted with an associated contributing factor of zero.  The sum of ALPHASJ should be less than one.  This is because one minus the sum of ALPHASJ is equal to the alpha term (alpha n in equation 4-61 of the GWF Model report) that is multiplied by the head in cell n. |

| GWT | DISU | OPTIONS | VERTICAL_OFFSET_TOLERANCE | DOUBLE PRECISION | checks are performed to ensure that the top of a cell is not higher than the bottom of an overlying cell.  This option can be used to specify the tolerance that is used for checking.  If top of a cell is above the bottom of an overlying cell by a value less than this tolerance, then the program will not terminate with an error.  The default value is zero.  This option should generally not be used. |
| GWT | DISU | DIMENSIONS | NODES | INTEGER | is the number of cells in the model grid. |
| GWT | DISU | DIMENSIONS | NJA | INTEGER | is the sum of the number of connections and NODES.  When calculating the total number of connections, the connection between cell n and cell m is considered to be different from the connection between cell m and cell n.

| GWT | DISU | DIMENSIONS | NVERT | INTEGER | is the total number of (x, y) vertex pairs used to define the plan-view shape of each cell in the model grid.  If NVERT is not specified or is specified as zero, then the VERTICES and CELL2D blocks below are not read.  NVERT and the accompanying VERTICES and CELL2D blocks should be specified for most simulations.  If the XT3D or SAVE\_SPECIFIC\_DISCHARGE options are specified in the NPF Package, then this information is required. |
| GWT | DISU | GRIDDATA | TOP | DOUBLE PRECISION (NODES) | is the top elevation for each cell in the model grid. |
| GWT | DISU | GRIDDATA | BOT | DOUBLE PRECISION (NODES) | is the bottom elevation for each cell. |
| GWT | DISU | GRIDDATA | AREA | DOUBLE PRECISION (NODES) | is the cell surface area (in plan view). |
| GWT | DISU | GRIDDATA | IDOMAIN | INTEGER (NODES) | is an optional array that characterizes the existence status of a cell.  If the IDOMAIN array is not specified, then all model cells exist within the solution.  If the IDOMAIN value for a cell is 0, the cell does not exist in the simulation.  Input and output values will be read and written for the cell, but internal to the program, the cell is excluded from the solution.  If the IDOMAIN value for a cell is 1 or greater, the cell exists in the simulation.  IDOMAIN values of -1 cannot be specified for the DISU Package. |
| GWT | DISU | CONNECTIONDATA | IAC | INTEGER (NODES) | is the number of connections (plus 1) for each cell.  The sum of all the entries in IAC must be equal to NJA. |

The number of values to provide for cell n is IAC(n).  This list is sequentially provided for the first to the last cell. The first value in the list must be cell n itself, and the remaining cells must be listed in an increasing order (sorted from lowest number to highest).  Note that the cell and its connections are only supplied for the GWT cells and their connections to the other GWT cells.  Also note that the JA list input may be divided such that every node and its connectivity list can be on a separate line for ease in readability of the file. To further ease readability of the file, the node number of the cell whose connectivity is subsequently listed, may be expressed as a negative number, the sign of which is subsequently converted to positive by the code. |
| GWT | DISU | CONNECTIONDATA | IHC | INTEGER (NJA) | is an index array indicating the direction between node n and all of its m connections.  If IHC = 0 then cell n and cell m are connected in the vertical direction.  Cell n overlies cell m if the cell number for n is less than m; cell m overlies cell n if the cell number for m is less than n.  If IHC = 1 then cell n and cell m are connected in the horizontal direction.  If IHC = 2 then cell n and cell m are connected in the horizontal direction, and the connection is vertically staggered.  A vertically staggered connection is one in which a cell is horizontally connected to more than one cell in a horizontal connection. |
| GWT | DISU | CONNECTIONDATA | CL12 | DOUBLE PRECISION (NJA) | is the array containing connection lengths between the center of cell n and the shared face with each adjacent m cell. |
| GWT | DISU | CONNECTIONDATA | HWVA | DOUBLE PRECISION (NJA) | is a symmetric array of size NJA.  For horizontal connections, entries in HWVA are the horizontal width perpendicular to flow.  For vertical connections, entries in HWVA are the vertical area for flow.  Thus, values in the HWVA array contain dimensions of both length and area.  Entries in the HWVA array have a one-to-one correspondence with the connections specified in the JA array.  Likewise, there is a one-to-one correspondence between entries in the HWVA array and entries in the IHC array, which specifies the connection type (horizontal or vertical).  Entries in the HWVA array must be symmetric; the program will terminate with an error if the value for HWVA for an n to m connection does not equal the value for HWVA for the corresponding n to m connection. |
| GWT | DISU | CONNECTIONDATA | ANGLDEGX | DOUBLE PRECISION (NJA) | is the angle (in degrees) between the horizontal x-axis and the outward normal to the face between a cell and its connecting cells. The angle varies between zero and 360.0 degrees, where zero degrees points in the positive x-axis direction, and 90 degrees points in the positive y-axis direction.  ANGLDEGX is only needed if horizontal anisotropy is specified in the NPF Package, if the XT3D option is used in the NPF Package, or if the SAVE\_SPECIFIC\_DISCHARGE option is specifed in the NPF Package.  ANGLDEGX does not need to be specified if these conditions are not met.  ANGLDEGX is of size NJA; values specified for vertical connections and for the diagonal position are not used.  Note that ANGLDEGX is read in degrees, which is different from MODFLOW-USG, which reads a similar variable (ANGLEX) in radians. |

PNAME character values are read and stored by the program for stress packages only.  These names may be useful for labeling purposes when multiple stress packages of the same type are located within a single GWT Model.  If PNAME is specified for a stress package, then PNAME will be used in the flow budget table in the listing file; it will also be used for the text entry in the cell-by-cell budget file.  PNAME is case insensitive and is stored in all upper case letters. |

| GWT | SSM | SOURCES | PNAME | STRING | name of the flow package for which an auxiliary variable contains a source concentration.  If this flow package is represented using an advanced transport package (SFT, LKT, MWT, or UZT), then the advanced transport package will override SSM terms specified here. |
| GWT | SSM | SOURCES | SRCTYPE | STRING | keyword indicating how concentration will be assigned for sources and sinks.  Keyword must be specified as either AUX or AUXMIXED.  For both options the user must provide an auxiliary variable in the corresponding flow package.  The auxiliary variable must have the same name as the AUXNAME value that follows.  If the AUX keyword is specified, then the auxiliary variable specified by the user will be assigned as the concentration value for groundwater sources (flows with a positive sign).  For negative flow rates (sinks), groundwater will be withdrawn from the cell at the simulated concentration of the cell.  The AUXMIXED option provides an alternative method for how to determine the concentration of sinks.  If the cell concentration is larger than the user-specified auxiliary concentration, then the concentration of groundwater withdrawn from the cell will be assigned as the user-specified concentration.  Alternatively, if the user-specified auxiliary concentration is larger than the cell concentration, then groundwater will be withdrawn at the cell concentration.  Thus, the AUXMIXED option is designed to work with the Evapotranspiration (EVT) and Recharge (RCH) Packages where water may be withdrawn at a concentration that is less than the cell concentration. |

The SPC6\_FILENAME file is a flexible input file that allows concentrations to be specified by stress period and with time series. Instructions for creating the SPC6\_FILENAME input file are provided in the next section on file input for boundary concentrations. |
| GWT | SSM | FILEINPUT | MIXED | KEYWORD | keyword to specify that these stress package boundaries will have the mixed condition.  The MIXED condition is described in the SOURCES block for AUXMIXED.  The MIXED condition allows for water to be withdrawn at a concentration that is less than the cell concentration.  It is intended primarily for representing evapotranspiration. |
| GWT | SRC | OPTIONS | AUXILIARY | STRING (NAUX) | defines an array of one or more auxiliary variable names.  There is no limit on the number of auxiliary variables that can be provided on this line; however, lists of information provided in subsequent blocks must have a column of data for each auxiliary variable name defined here.   The number of auxiliary variables detected on this line determines the value for naux.  Comments cannot be provided anywhere on this line as they will be interpreted as auxiliary variable names.  Auxiliary variables may not be used by the package, but they will be available for use by other parts of the program.  The program will terminate with an error if auxiliary variables are specified on more than one line in the options block. |

For a structured grid that uses the DIS input file, CELLID is the layer, row, and column.   For a grid that uses the DISV input file, CELLID is the layer and CELL2D number.  If the model uses the unstructured discretization (DISU) input file, CELLID is the node number for the cell. |

RETFACTOR may be assigned any real value.  A RETFACTOR value greater than 1 represents particle retardation (slowing), and a value of 1 represents no retardation.  The effect of specifying a RETFACTOR value for each cell is the same as the effect of directly multiplying the POROSITY in each cell by the proposed RETFACTOR value for each cell.

| PRT | PRP | OPTIONS | DRAPE | KEYWORD | is a text keyword to indicate that a particle is to be moved to the topmost active cell prior to release if its release point is in a cell that is dry at the scheduled time of release.

For a structured grid that uses the DIS input file, CELLID is the layer, row, and column.   For a grid that uses the DISV input file, CELLID is the layer and CELL2D number.  If the model uses the unstructured discretization (DISU) input file, CELLID is the node number for the cell. |

If dtfailadj is zero or one, then time steps will not be retried with shorter lengths.  In this case, the program will terminate with an error, or it will continue of the CONTINUE option is set in the simulation name file.  Initial tests with this variable should be set to 5.0 or larger to determine if convergence can be achieved. |
