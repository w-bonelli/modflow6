This section describes the data files for a \mf Groundwater Flow (GWF) Model.  A GWF Model is added to the simulation by including a GWF entry in the MODELS block of the simulation name file.

There are three types of spatial discretization approaches that can be used with the GWF Model.  Input for a GWF Model may be entered in a structured form, like for previous MODFLOW versions, in that users specify cells using their layer, row, and column indices.  Users may also work with a layered grid in which cells are defined using vertices.  In this case, users specify cells using the layer number and the cell number.  Lastly, GWF Models may be entered as fully unstructured models, in which cells are specified using only their cell number.  Once a spatial discretization approach has been selected, then all input with cell indices must be entered accordingly.

The GWF Model is designed to permit input to be gathered, as it is needed, from many different files.  Likewise, results from the model calculations can be written to a number of output files. The GWF Model Listing File is a key file to which the GWF model output is written.  As \mf runs, information about the GWF Model is written to the GWF Model Listing File, including much of the input data (as a record of the simulation) and calculated results.  Details about the files used by each package are provided in this section on the GWF Model Instructions.

\mf is further designed to allow the user to control the amount, type, and frequency of information to be output. Much of the output will be written to the Simulation and GWF Model Listing Files, but some model output can be written to other files.  The Listing Files can become very large for common models.  Text editors are useful for examining the Listing File. The GWF Model Listing File includes a summary of the input data read for all packages.  In addition, the GWF Model Listing File optionally contains calculated head controlled by time step, and the overall volumetric budget controlled by time step. The Listing Files also contain information about solver convergence and error messages.  Output to other files can include head and cell-by-cell flow terms for use in calculations external to the model or in user-supplied applications such as plotting programs.

The GWF Model reads a file called the Name File, which specifies most of the files that will be used in a simulation. Several files are always required whereas other files are optional depending on the simulation. The Output Control Package receives instructions from the user to control the amount and frequency of output.  Details about the Name File and the Output Control Package are described in this section.

\subsection{Units of Length and Time}
The GWF Model formulates the groundwater flow equation without using prescribed length and time units. Any consistent units of length and time can be used when specifying the input data for a simulation. This capability gives a certain amount of freedom to the user, but care must be exercised to avoid mixing units.  The program cannot detect the use of inconsistent units.  For example, if hydraulic conductivity is entered in units of feet per day and pumpage as cubic meters per second, the program will run, but the results will be meaningless. Other processes generally are expected to work with consistent length and time units; however, other processes could conceivably place restrictions on which units are supported.

The user can set flags that specify the length and time units (see the input instructions for the Timing Module and Spatial Discretization Files), which may be useful in various parts of MODFLOW.  For example, the program will label the table of simulation time with time units if the time units are specified by the optional TIME\_UNITS label, which can be set in the TDIS Package.  If the time units are not specified, the program still runs, but the table of simulation time does not indicate the time units. An optional LENGTH\_UNITS label can be set in the Discretization Package. Situations in other processes may require that the length or time units be specified.  In such situations, the input instructions will state the requirements. Remember that specifying the unit flags does not enforce consistent use of units.  The user must insure that consistent units are used in all input data.

\subsection{Steady-State Simulations}
A steady-state simulation is represented by a single stress period having a single time step with the storage term set to zero. Setting the number and length of stress periods and time steps is the responsibility of the Timing Module of the \mf framework. The length of the stress period and time step will not affect the head solution because the time derivative is not calculated in a steady-state problem. Setting the storage term to zero is the responsibility of the Storage Package. Most other packages need not "know" that a simulation is steady state.

A GWF Model also can be mixed transient and steady state because each stress period can be designated transient or steady state.  Thus, a GWF Model can start with a steady-state stress period and continue with one or more transient stress periods.  The settings for controlling steady-state and transient options are in the Storage Package.  If the Storage Package is not specified for a GWF Model, then the storage terms are zero and the GWF Model will be steady state.

\subsection{Volumetric Budget}
A summary of all inflows (sources) and outflows (sinks) of water is called a water budget.  The water budget for the GWF Model is termed a volumetric budget because volumes of water and volumetric flow rates are involved; thus strictly speaking, a volumetric budget is not a mass balance, although this term has been used in other model reports.  \mf calculates a water budget for the overall model as a check on the acceptability of the solution, and to provide a summary of the sources and sinks of water to the flow system.  The water budget is printed to the GWF Model Listing File for selected time steps.

Numerical solution techniques for simultaneous equations do not always result in a correct answer; in particular, iterative solvers may stop iterating before a sufficiently close approximation to the solution is attained.  A water budget provides an indication of the overall acceptability of the solution.  The system of equations solved by the model actually consists of a flow continuity statement for each model cell.  Continuity should also exist for the total flows into and out of the model---that is, the difference between total inflow and total outflow should equal the total change in storage.  In the model program, the water budget is calculated independently of the equation solution process, and in this sense may provide independent evidence of a valid solution.

The total budget as printed in the output does not include internal flows between model cells---only flows into or out of the model as a whole. For example, flow to or from rivers, flow to or from constant-head cells, and flow to or from wells are all included in the overall budget terms.  Flow into and out of storage is also considered part of the overall budget inasmuch as accumulation in storage effectively removes water from the flow system and storage release effectively adds water to the flow---even though neither process, in itself, involves the transfer of water into or out of the ground-water regime.  Each hydrologic package calculates its own contribution to the budget.

For every time step, the budget subroutine of each hydrologic package calculates the rate of flow into and out of the system due to the process simulated by the package.  The inflows and outflows for each component of flow are stored separately.  Most packages deal with only one such component of flow.  In addition to flow, the volumes of water entering and leaving the model during the time step are calculated as the product of flow rate and time-step length.  Cumulative volumes, from the beginning of the simulation, are then calculated and stored.

The GWF Model uses the inflows, outflows, and cumulative volumes to write the budget to the Listing File at the times requested by the model user.  When a budget is written, the flow rates for the last time step and cumulative volumes from the beginning of simulation are written for each component of flow.  Inflows are written separately from outflows.  Following the convention indicated above, water entering storage is treated as an outflow (that is, as a loss of water from the flow system) while water released from storage is treated as an inflow (that is, a source of water to the flow system).  In addition, total inflow and total outflow are written, as well as the difference between total inflow and outflow.  The difference is then written as a percentage error, calculated using the formula:

\begin{equation}
D = \frac{100 (IN-OUT)}{(IN + OUT) / 2}
\end{equation}

\noindent where $D$ is the percentage error term, $IN$ is the total inflow to the system, and $OUT$ is the total outflow.

If the model equations are solved correctly, the percentage error should be small.  In general, flow rates may be taken as an indication of solution validity for the time step to which they apply, while cumulative volumes are an indication of validity for the entire simulation up to the time of the output.  The budget is written to the GWF Model Listing File at the end of each stress period whether requested or not.

\subsection{Cell-By-Cell Flows}
In some situations, calculating flow terms for various subregions of the model is useful.  To facilitate such calculations, provision has been made to save flow terms for individual cells in a separate binary file so they can be used in computations external to the model itself.  These individual cell flows are referred to here as ``cell-by-cell'' flow terms and are of four general types: (1) cell-by-cell stress flows, or flows into or from an individual cell caused by one of the external stresses represented in the model, such as evapotranspiration or recharge; (2) cell-by-cell storage terms, which give the rate of accumulation or depletion of storage in an individual cell; and (3) internal cell-by-cell flows, which are actually the flows across individual cell faces---that is, between adjacent model cells.  These four kinds of cell-by-cell flow terms are discussed further in subsequent paragraphs.  To save any of these cell-by-cell terms, two flags in the model input must be set.  The input to the Output Control file indicates the time steps for which cell-by-cell terms are to be saved. In addition, each hydrologic package includes an option called SAVE\_FLOWS that must be set if the cell-by-cell terms computed by that package are to be saved.  Thus, if the appropriate option in the Evapotranspiration Package input is set, cell-by-cell evapotranspiration terms will be saved for each time step for which the saving of cell-by-cell flow is requested through the Output Control Option.  Only flow values are saved in the cell-by-cell files; neither water volumes nor cumulative water volumes are included.  The flow dimensions are volume per unit time, where volume and time are in the same units used for all model input data.  The cell-by-cell flow values are stored in unformatted form to make the most efficient use of disk space; see the Budget File section toward the end of this user guide for information on how the data are written to a file.

The cell-by-cell storage term gives the net flow to or from storage in a variable-head cell.  The net storage for each cell in the grid is saved in transient simulations if the appropriate flags are set.  Withdrawal from storage in the cell is considered positive, whereas accumulation in storage is considered negative.

The cell-by-cell constant-head flow term gives the flow into or out of an individual constant-head cell (specified with the CHD Package).  This term is always associated with the constant-head cell itself, rather than with the surrounding cells that contribute or receive the flow.  A constant-head cell may be surrounded by as many as six adjacent variable-head cells for a regular grid or any number of cells for the other grid types.  The cell-by-cell calculation provides a single flow value for each constant-head cell, representing the algebraic sum of the flows between that cell and all of the adjacent variable-head cells.  A positive value indicates that the net flow is away from the constant-head cell (into the variable-head part of the grid); a negative value indicates that the net flow is into the constant-head cell.

The internal cell-by-cell flow values represent flows across the individual faces of a model cell.  Flows between cells are written in the compressed row storage format, whereby the flow between cell $n$ and each one of its connecting $m$ neighbor cells are contained in a single one-dimensional array.  Flows are positive for the cell in question.  Thus the flow reported for cell $n$ and its connection with cell $m$ is opposite in sign to the flow reported for cell $m$ and its connection with cell $n$.  These internal cell-by-cell flow values are useful in calculations of the groundwater flow into various subregions of the model, or in constructing flow vectors.

Cell-by-cell stress flows are flow rates into or out of the model, at a particular cell, owing to one particular external stress.  For example, the cell-by-cell evapotranspiration term for cell $n$ would give the flow out of the model by evapotranspiration from cell $n$.  Cell-by-cell stress flows are considered positive if flow is into the cell, and negative if out of the cell.
