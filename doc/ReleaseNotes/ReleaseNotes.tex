\section{Introduction}
This document describes MODFLOW~6 Version \modflowversion.  This distribution is packaged for personal computers using modern versions of the Microsoft Windows, Macintosh, and Linux operating systems, although the programs included in the distribution may run on older operating system versions.  The binary executable files in the distribution should run on most personal computers.

Version numbers for MODFLOW~6 follow a major.minor.revision format.  The major number is increased when there are substantial new changes that may break backward compatibility.  The minor number is increased when important, but relatively minor new functionality is added.  The revision number is incremented when errors are corrected in either the program or input files.

MODFLOW~6 is tested with a large number of example problems, and new capabilities are thoroughly tested as they are integrated into the program.  Additional testing can sometimes reveal errors in the program.  These errors are fixed as soon as possible and made available in a subsequent release.  Every effort is made to maintain backward compatibility of the format for MODFLOW~6 input files; however, this goal is not always possible, especially for newer packages and models.  Changes to the program to add new functionality, correct errors, or alter the format for an input file are summarized in this release notes document.

\section{Release History}
A list of all MODFLOW 6 releases is shown in table \ref{tab:releases}.  Changes introduced in previous releases are described in Appendix~\ref{app:A}.

\section{Changes Introduced in this Release}
This section describes changes introduced into MODFLOW~6 for the current release.  These changes may substantially affect users.

\begin{itemize}
\input{v6.4.1.tex}
\end{itemize}

% -------------------------------------------------
\section{Known Issues and Incompatibilities}
This section describes known issues with this release of MODFLOW~6.  

\begin{enumerate}

\item
The AUXMULTNAME option can be used to scale input values, such as riverbed conductance, using values in an auxiliary column.  When this AUXMULTNAME option is used, the multiplier value in the AUXMULTNAME column should not be represented with a time series unless the value to scale is also represented with a time series.  

\item
The capability to use Unsaturated Zone Flow (UZF) routing beneath lakes and streams has not been implemented.

\item
For the Groundwater Transport (GWT) Model, the decay and sorption processes do not apply to the LKT, SFT, MWT and UZT Packages.

\item
The GWT Model does not work with the CSUB Package of the GWF Model.  

\item
The GWT-GWT Exchange requires that both GWF Models are run concurrently in the same simulation.  There is not an option to read GWF-GWF flows from a previous simulation.

\item
The Buoyancy (BUY) Package of the GWF Model cannot be used when the XT3D option is activated for the Node Property Flow (NPF) Package.

\item
If a GWF-GWF Exchange is activated with the XT3D option, then the two connected GWF Models cannot have BUY Packages active.

\item
The Time-Variable Hydraulic Conductivity (TVK) Package is incompatible with the Horizontal Flow Barrier (HFB) Package if the TVK Package is used to change hydraulic properties of cells near horizontal flow barriers.

\item
If a GWF-GWF Exchange is active, then neither of the connected GWF Models can have an active Viscosity (VSC) Package.

\end{enumerate}

In addition to the issues shown here, a comprehensive and up-to-date list is available under the issues tab at \url{https://github.com/MODFLOW-USGS/modflow6}.


% -------------------------------------------------
\section{Distribution File}
The following distribution file is for use on personal computers: \texttt{\modflowversion.zip}.  The distribution file is a compressed zip file. The following directory structure is incorporated in the zip file:

% folder structured created by python script
\input{folder_struct.tex}

It is recommended that no user files are kept in the \modflowversion~directory structure.  If you do plan to put your own files in the \modflowversion~directory structure, do so only by creating additional subdirectories.

% -------------------------------------------------
\section{Installation and Execution}
There is no installation of MODFLOW~6 other than the requirement that \texttt{\modflowversion.zip} must be unzipped into a location where it can be accessed.  

To make the executable versions of MODFLOW~6 accessible from any directory, the directory containing the executables should be included in the PATH environment variable.  Also, if a prior release of MODFLOW~6 is installed on your system, the directory containing the executables for the prior release should be removed from the PATH environment variable.

As an alternative, the executable file, named ``\texttt{mf6.exe}'' on Windows, in the \modflowversion{}/bin directory can be copied into a directory already included in the PATH environment variable.

To run MODFLOW~6, simply type \texttt{mf6} in a terminal window.  The current working directory must be set to a location where the model input files are located.  Upon execution, MODFLOW~6 will immediately look for file with the name \texttt{mfsim.nam} in the current working directory, and will terminate with an error if it does not find this file.

% -------------------------------------------------
\section{Compiling MODFLOW~6}
MODFLOW~6 has been compiled using Intel Fortran and gfortran on the Windows, Mac, and Linux operating systems.  Because the program uses relatively new Fortran extensions, newer versions of the compilers may be required for successful compilation.  For example, to use gfortran to compile MODFLOW~6, gfortran version 4.9 or newer must be used.  If you have gfortran installed on your computer, you can tell which version it is by entering ``\verb|gfortran --version|'' at a terminal window.

This distribution contains the Microsoft Visual Studio solution and project files for compiling MODFLOW~6 on Windows using the Intel Fortran Compiler.  The files have been used successfully with recent versions of Microsoft Visual Studio Community 2019 and the Intel Fortran Compiler.  To compile MODFLOW~6, open the mf6.sln file in the msvs folder and click Build >  Build Solution.  A separate Visual Studio solution file is also included for building the BMI dynamically linked library version of MODFLOW~6.

This distribution also comes with a makefile for compiling MODFLOW~6 with \texttt{gfortran}.  The makefile is contained in the \texttt{make} folder.

For those familiar with Python, the pymake package can also be used to compile MODFLOW~6.  Additional information on the Python pymake utility can be found at: \url{https://github.com/modflowpy/pymake}.  

% -------------------------------------------------
\section{System Requirements}
MODFLOW~6 is written in Fortran.  It uses features from the 95, 2003, and 2008 language.  The code has been used on UNIX-based computers and personal computers running various forms of the Microsoft Windows operating system.

% -------------------------------------------------
\section{Testing}
The examples distributed with MODFLOW~6 can be run on Windows by navigating to the examples folder and executing the ``\texttt{run.bat}'' batch files within each example folder.  Alternatively, there is a ``\texttt{runall.bat}'' batch file under the examples folder that will run all of the test problems.  For Linux and Mac distributions, equivalent shell scripts (\texttt{run.sh} and \texttt{runall.sh}) are included.

% -------------------------------------------------
