	\textbf{\underline{BUG FIXES AND OTHER CHANGES TO EXISTING FUNCTIONALITY}} \\
	\underline{BASIC FUNCTIONALITY}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item With the LOCAL\_Z option enabled, the PRT model's PRP package attempted to check that a particle release point's z coordinate fell within the grid's vertical extent before converting the coordinate from local (normalized on the unit interval) to a global (model) coordinate. This bug was fixed by converting coordinates before conducting checks.
		\item The PRT model could hang upon particle termination due to no (sub)cell exit face. This occurred because a flag signaling particle advance was not set in the proper location.
		\item Entangled with the previous issue, the ternary method could erroneously terminate a particle and report no exit face (before now this would hang) due to precision error in the exit time/position calculation. This could happen when two conditions are both met: the particle enters the subcell very close to one of its vertices, and flow very nearly parallels one of the subcell's faces. We have encountered similar situations before, solved by nudging the particle a small distance into the interior of the subcell before applying the tracking method. This particular case is resolved by increasing the padding distance from $\sisetup{input-digits = 0123456789\epsilon} \num{\epsilon e+2}$ to $\sisetup{input-digits = 0123456789\epsilon} \num{\epsilon e+5}$, where $\epsilon$ is machine precision.
		\item For ASCII input files erroneously containing a mix of line endings, MODFLOW would sometimes proceed with unexpected results. The program was corrected to stop with an error message if an input line contained both carriage returns and line feeds.
		\item Previously the PRT model's default behavior was to track particles until termination, as with MODPATH 7 stop time option 2 (extend). Under extended tracking, the program may not halt if particles enter a cycle in the flow system. This PR changes the default to the equivalent of MP7 stop time option 1 (final), terminating at simulation end unless a new Particle Release Point (PRP) package keyword option EXTEND\_TRACKING is provided. This is meant to provide a stronger guarantee that the program halts under default settings.
		\item A refactor of the energy storage and transfer (EST) package associated with the GWE model type results in different input requirements that breaks backward compatibility with what was required in version 6.5.0.  The PACKAGEDATA block was removed from the EST package input.  In its place, the heat capabity of water, the specified density of water, and the latent heat of vaporization are instead given default values that can be overridden by specifying alternative values in the OPTIONS block.
		\item The PRT model's cell face flows were improperly combined with boundary flows; for cell faces with active neighbors, the face flow replaced any boundary flows (likely a rare situation because IFLOWFACE is typically applied to faces on the boundary of the active domain). The face flow calculation has been corrected.
		\item Previously the PRT model's PRP package required release points to be specified in the model coordinate system (except for the z coordinate via the LOCAL\_Z option). PRT also previously reported pathlines in the model coordinate system. The PRT model now supports coordinate transformations for release point input and pathline output via keyword options for the PRP package, while preserving the existing default model coordinate system. Release point x and y coordinates may now be specified for structured grids with reference to the local rectilinear cell (with coordinates scaled to the unit interval) via the LOCAL\_XY keyword option. The LOCAL\_XY\_OFFSET option, supported for structured or unstructured grids, can be used to locate release point x and y coordinates at an offset from the cell center (with no distance rescaling). A development option DEV\_GLOBAL\_XY is also provided, enabling transformation of release points from (and pathline points to) the global coordinate system for georeferenced grids.
